Mr.

says

investors
``

he

But
much
will
depend
on
how
quickly

Lotus

in

to

,
the
New

of

people
familiar
with
the

said
.

He
would
n't
elaborate
.

And
in
a
footnote
to
the
fall
of
House
Speaker
James
Wright
this
year
,
the
conference
voted
to
rescind
$
11.8

We
should
also
add
Mr.
Lawson
's
own
explanation
,
as
we
understand
it
.

Mr.
Meek
said
that
a
day
or
two
before
Lincoln
's
parent
entered
bankruptcy
proceedings
,
he
and
other
examiners
saw
``
a
truck
with
a
sign
on
it
that
said
it
was
from
the
`
Document
Destruction
Center
.
'

They
want
it
back
.

He
acknowledged
only
one
difference
with
Mr.
Reagan
--
that
the
amendment
ought
to
have
exceptions
for
rape
and
incest
as
well
as
to
save
a

's
life
.

But
they
will
work
together
on
energy
-
,
environmental
-
and
fair-trade-related
issues
and
conduct
seminars
on
topics
of
mutual
interest
,
said
Gibson
Gayle
Jr.
of
585-lawyer
Fulbright

Jaworski
.

By
accounting
definitions
,
this
had
to
produce
a
sudden
trade
deficit
.

Just
a
short
span
across
the
bay
to
the
west
,
the
quake
also
showed
its
mettle
:
A

Marina

lies
smoldering
under
a
steady

being
pumped

prevent
it
from
blazing
anew
.

Also
,
it
is
n't
exposed
to
the
weakening
newsprint
business
,
and
is
strong
in
the
less-cyclical
tissue
business

At
the
auction

U.S.

,
the

A
spokesman
for
LTV
Steel
,
which
is

Dallas-based
LTV
Corp.

noted
that
steel
prices

increased
only
1.7

1981
and
the
fourth
quarter
of
1988
,
while
the
prices
of
other
industrial
commodities
increased
nearly
five
times
as
much
.

``

Mr.

But
it
is
estimated
that

possibly
as
much
as
seven

Certainly
life
for

changed
considerably

lived

in
a
2

in
what
she
calls

On

Nicholas

Adverse

from
the

surrounding
its

strife
have
put
pressure
on

Nevertheless
,
the
problems
of
the
junk

could
prompt
the
Federal

ease

Mr.

Mr.
Paul
boasts
that
he
spotted
bargains
in
old
masters
just
before
they
took
an
upward
turn
.

Critics
warned
such
cash
contributions
may
only
undercut
the
opposition
party
's
standing
,
and
one
irony
is
that
under
Nicaraguan
law
a
major
portion
of
the
opposition
party
's
funds
must
be
shared
with
the
government
's
Supreme

So
do
just
about
all
the
losses
that
could
be
attributed
to
the
sheer
incompetence
of
unqualified

That

quite
the

instituted

crash
and
implemented
for

Instead
,
Mr.
Bush
and
his
aides
made
it
clear
they
respected
Congress
's
role
and
felt
they
could
work
with

In

I
do
n't

rule
out

also
come
a

The
contact

through

Panamanian
diplomat
based

With
the
dust
settling
from
the
failed
coup
attempt
in
Panama
,
one
of
the
many
lingering
questions
the
Bush
administration
will
ponder
is
this
:
Is
the
National
Security
Council
staff
big
enough
,
and
does
it
have
enough
clout
,
to
do
its
job
of
coordinating
foreign
policy
?

In

The
association
between
the

back
thirty

to
a
friendship
between
television

Mark
Goodson
and
Ingersoll

Ralph

Today

for

150

,
12-year
senior
subordinated

Loans
for

long
as
five
years
make
the

very
accessible
,

payments
as
low

A

137.6
million
Maryland
Stadium
Authority

appeared
to
be
off
to
a
good
start

The
charge
represents
a
write-down
of
the
goodwill
associated
with
Poughkeepsie
's
investment
in
the
banks
it
is
trying
to
sell
and
its
North

branches
as
well

The

outlines
a

were
booked
as

and
inventory
forgeries

The
union
sued
the
state
in
November
1985
,
alleging
that
it
intentionally
segregated
job
classifications
by
sex

paid
employees
in
predominantly
female
jobs
less
than
males
in
comparable
jobs
.

The
lack
of
any
new
cash
probably
would
still
leave
the
banks
dissatisfied
.

These
would
not
function
independently
,
but
would
act
together
to
form
``
combines
,
unions
and
associations
''
to
tackle
problems
and
coordinate
their
activities

In

,
the
current
weakness

The
team
was
composed
of
representatives
from
engineering
,
manufacturing
,
corporate
estimating
,
flight
test
,
material
,
quality
control
,
and
other
departments
.

Likewise
,
mutual
funds
remained
relatively
flat
until
I
made
what
was
,
for
me
,
a
serious
investment
.

The
funeral
home
and
cemetery
operator
changed
from
a
fiscal
year
to
a
calendar
year
in
December
.

I
got
home
,
let
the
dogs
into
the
house
and
noticed
some
sounds
above
my
head
,
as
if
someone
were
walking
on
the
roof
,
or
upstairs
.

Three
other
Haagen
shopping
centers
in
the
Watts
area
are
doing
almost
as
well
.

The
Pentagon
's
recently
issued
``
Soviet
Military
Power
,
''
though
in
general
adopting
a
softer
line
,
repeated
the
Sverdlovsk
assessment
.

Bethlehem
Steel
's
profit
plunged
54
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
hurt
by
higher
costs
and
lower
shipments
to
key
clients
.

TIMES
SQUARE
development
opponents
are
dealt
setback
.

Also
,
he
estimated
unit
shipments
of
1-2-3
in
all
its
forms
were
about
315,000
,
up
7
%
from
1988
's
quarterly
average
.

Big
auction
houses
want
to
make
collectibles
eligible
for
lower
capital-gains
taxes
.

The
cafeteria
offered
donated
croissants
and
brie
for
breakfast
,
and
for
dinner
,
pasta
salad
and
chocolate
mousse
torts
along
with
the
salmon
.

``
This
is
beautiful
stuff
,
''
he
says
,
looking
ruefully
at
big
boxes
of
just-picked
Red
Delicious
next
to
his
barn
.

``
In
some
places
the
stonework
is
so
damaged
it
shows
signs
of
breaking
off
,
''
scientists
and
technicians
said
in
a
report
to
Public
Works
Minister
Giovanni
Prandini
.

A
resistance
government
would
walk
into
Kabul
.

The
282
members
had
paid
$
10,000
apiece
for
seats
.

Mr.
Taylor
's
overwhelming
victory
against
Republican
Tom
Anderson
reclaims
a
seat
the
Republicans
had
held
for
17
years
and
gives
the
Democrats
their
fifth
victory
in
the
seven
special
House
elections
held
this
year
.

The
two
developments
put
the
acquisition
attempt
back
to
square
one
and
leaves
the
airline
with
an
array
of
unresolved
matters
,
including
an
unsettled
labor
situation
and
a
management
scrambling
to
restore
its
damaged
credibility
.

Seats
currently
are
quoted
at
$
361,000
bid
,
$
395,000
asked
.

For
his
troubles
,
Mr.
Chan
was
jailed
three
times
between
1960
and
1974
.

A
Generale
spokesman
confirmed
that
the
giant
Belgian
holding
company
would
be
willing
to
raise
its
stake
in
AG
should
a
raider
seek
control
.

Debenture
holders
also
will
receive
the
equivalent
of
10
%
of
the
common
stock
in
Chicago
&
North
Western
's
parent
company
.

On
top
of
all
this
,
foreign-debt
repayments
are
expected
to
peak
in
1991
to
1992
.

Futures
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
a
zero
sum
game
--
a
market
for
making
side
bets
about
the
direction
of
stock
prices
.

That
would
would
make
it
appealing
to
a
network
such
as
Interpublic
that
already
has
a
healthy
New
York
presence
.

But
starting
in
early
September
,
the
index
started
to
slide
and
now
stands
about
even
with
the
S&P
500
.

Mr.
Bullock
says
45

tied
to

.

``
I
've
always
relied
heavily
on
the
grid
and
found
it
never

fail
.
''

To
the
extent
that
the
primary
duty
of
personal
staff
involves
local
benefit-seeking
,
this
indicates
that
political
philosophy
leads
congressional
Republicans
to
pay
less
attention
to
narrow
constituent
concerns
.

Kurds
,
suffering
what
many
people
consider
to
be
a
current
extermination
campaign
at
the
hands
of
Syria
,
Iran
and
Iraq
have
inundated
eastern
Turkey
.

Their
$
700
million-plus
in
estimated
paper
losses
easily
tops
the
$
400
million
in
paper
losses
the
takeover
traders
,
known
as
arbitragers
,
suffered
in
1982
when
Gulf
Oil
Co.
dropped
a
$
4.8
billion
offer
for
Cities
Service
Co
.

Market
participants
said
that
the
mark
continues
to
post
the
most
significant
gains
against
the
dollar
.

Through
the
first
nine
months
,
the
company
had
a
loss
of
$
484
million
,
largely
reflecting
the
closing
of
its
supercomputer
unit
.

These
figures
omit
secondary
guarantees
,
deposit
insurance
,
and
the
activities
of

its
own

Honeywell
said
it
is
negotiating
the
sale
of
a
second

,
but
indicated
it
intends
to
hold
at
least
20
%
of
the
joint
venture
's
stock
long
term
.

However
,
Mr.
Moran
added
that
the
Japanese
generally
have
a
positive
view
of
the
U.S.
bond
market
because
of
expectations
that
the
dollar
will
remain
strong
and
interest
rates
will
decline
.

This

and
finally

What
better
place
to
turn
than
Sen.

Kennedy
's
Labor

,
that
great
stove
of

expansionism
,
where
many
a
stagnant

kept
on
the
back
burner

it
can
be
brought

In

a

said
he

``

Mr.

contends
that

the

fails
because
it
presents
only

Repeal
is
considered
likely
now
,
but
the
Treasury
Department
bill
has
been
used
as
a
vehicle
to
raise
the
profile
of
the
issue
and
block
any
action
in
the
interim
.

The
30-year
issue
was
priced
at
a
spread
of
105
basis
points
above
the
Treasury
's
30-year
bellwether
bond
.

If

continue
to
fall
,
many

would
be
better
off
walking
away
from

leaving

the
losses
.

Defining

aircraft
is

tougher

At
a
shareholders

in

,
the
tobacco

financial-services

retailing
giant
said
it

99.9

approval
from

to
spin
off
about
$
6
billion

If
both

The
House
version

kill

Moreover
,
Polaroid
contends
it

have
sold

If

At

into
West
Germany

center
,
the
opening
of
a
three-man
office
on
a
Frankfurt
side
street
should
n't
attract
much
attention
.

But
the
main
lesson
of
economic
policy
in
the
past
30
years
is
that
if
the
Fed
compromises
with
the
price-stability
objective
in
the
pursuit
of
these
other
goals
,
the
result
is
not
high
employment
and
rapid
growth

is
inflation

said

In
a
riveting
day
of
hearings
before
the
House
Banking
Committee
,
the
examiners
described
finding
shredded
documents
,
a
mysterious
Panamanian
subsidiary
,
millions
of
dollars
funneled
into
a
Swiss
bank
,
and
a
complacent
attitude
by
Mr.
Wall
's
deputies
,
one
of
whom
was
portrayed
as
acting
more
like
a
public-relations
man
for
the
thrift
than
a
federal
regulator
.

Others
point
out
that
lawyers
in
small
communities
have
always
had
a
feel
for
public
sentiment
--
and
used
that
to
advantage
.

The
probe
of
Southern
Co.
has
attracted
considerable
attention
this
year
because
of
several
events
that
have
befallen
the
company
,
including
the
death
of
a
Gulf
Power
executive
in
a
plane
crash
and
the
disappearance
of
a
company
vendor
who
was
to
be
a
key
grand
jury
witness
.

In
the
meantime
,
the
question
faced
by
investors
is
:
What
is
UAL
stock
worth
?

By
buying
the
space
in
bulk
,
they
obtain
discounts
as
high
as
50
%
,
which
they
can
pass
on
to
customers
.

Not
everyone
is
convinced
the
state
must
raise
new
revenue
to
meet
its
earthquake
needs
.

It
is
n't
clear
how
much
those
losses
may
widen
because
of
the
short
Series
.

The
action
came
as
Congress
sent
to
President
Bush
a
fiscal
1990
bill
providing
an
estimated
$
156.7
billion
for
the
Departments
of
Labor
,
Education
,
Health
and
Human
Services
.

Mr.
Guber
says
he
had
crossed
out
``
MGM
''
with
a
red
pen
and
written
in
``
Columbia
,
''
giving
the
document
to
Mr.
Semel
.

But
foreign
exploration
and
production
earnings
fell
sharply
,
to
$
12
million
from
$
95
million
.

The
slow-growing
mainframe
market
also
has
shown
new
signs
of
life
lately
.

But
it
's
hard
to
squeeze
much
profit
out
of
the
personal-computer
business
these
days
,
and
the
workstation
market
,
while
important
,
is
too
small
to
rely
on
for
much
growth
.

``
One
possibility
is
that
this
is
a
surgical
setback
,
reasonably
limited
in
its
breadth
,
and
not
a
major
problem
,
''
said
one
senior
administration
official
,
who
also
asked
that
he
not
be
named
.

Since
such
loans
are
often
refinanced
through
the
sale
of
high-risk
,
high-yield
junk
bonds
,
the
recent
woes
of
the
junk-bond
market
have
renewed
concerns
among
regulators
about
the
risks
associated
with
Wall
Street
firms
issuing
bridge
loans
.

It
has
sent
mixed
signals
about
its
willingness
to
take
part
in
the
exchange-rate
mechanism
of
the
European
Monetary
System
,

links
the
major
EC
currencies

his

Perhaps
most
dramatic
was
the
performance

booming

Mr.

Now

insist

climate

cold

gloomy

they
are
urging

to
buy
bonds
before
the
rally
begins

When
WCRS
created
Della
Femina
McNamee
out
of

merger
of
three
smaller
agency
units
in
1988
,
it
said
it
did
so
in
order
to
attract
larger
clients
,
especially
packaged-goods
companies
.

It
would
go
along
doing
nothing
but
dissociating
the
heavy
water
and
then
at
totally
unpredictable
times
,
it
would
begin
producing
excess
heat
for
as
long
as
10
or
11
hours
before
quieting
down
.

And
the
risks
are
n't
appropriate
for
us

he
says
.

The
judge
wrote
again
.

The
Southfield
,
Mich.-based
company
earned
$
774,000
in
the
quarter
last
year
.

That
's
leaving
small
investors
with
cold
feet
,
they
said
,
and
prompting
institutions
to
take
a
reserved
stance
on
the
sidelines
as
well
,
at
least
until
the
market
in
New

settles
down
somewhat
.

But
unless
they
continued
to
grow
,
TW
,
based
in
Paramus
,
N.J.
,
would
have
run
into
trouble
.

They
use
dollars
to
buy
Western
items
such
as
video
recorders
and
personal
computers
and
then
sell
them
at
a
huge
mark-up
.

Also
,
debt
holders
would
be
offered
an
equity
position
in
Leaseway
,
which
in
total
would
represent
a
controlling
interest
in
the
company
.

In
anticipation
of
that
shift
,
he
and
other
analysts
are
encouraging
their
clients
to
buy
such
issues
now
.

He
adds
:
``
The
junk
market
has
witnessed
some
trouble
and
now
some
people
think
that
if
the
equity
market
gets
creamed

the

will
be
terrible

that

Its

But
,
says
Mr.

``
It
was

One
of

For
several
months
,
officials
at
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration

have
suspected
that

Dr.

Some

the
most

was
an
amendment
that
provides
that
if
any
investor
holds
25
%
or
more
of
Rubbermaid

each

The

largely
an
offshoot

Last

a
rationale
for

:
Federal

arguably

As
with

plastic
in
Britain

The

The
real

is
directly
impacted

the

It

Whereas

In

,
some
of
the

are
so
close

that
non-financial

timing
may
play
a
more
important

In

The

.

But
the

has
dropped
any

However

Paul

and
is
``

Along
with
some
other
revealing
indicators
,
these
developments
suggest
that
while
Mr.
Gorbachev
wishes
to
move
away
from
some
rigid
central
controls
,
he
is
bent
on
creating
economic
structures

would
scarcely

as

clear
that

in

However
,
the
disclosure
of
the

,
first
reported
last
night
by
NBC
News
,
is
already
being
interpreted
on
Capitol
Hill
as
an
unfair
effort
to
pressure
Congress
.

President
Roh
Tae
Woo
's
administration
has
been
studying
the
real-estate
crisis
for
the
past
year
with
an
eye
to
partial
land
redistribution
.

Probing
more
deeply
into
the
doctrine
of
``
judicial
restraint
,
''
he
would
have
found
a
long
history
going
back
to
the
great
decisions
of
Justice
Holmes
.

Meanwhile
,
inside
the
courtroom
,
the

said
he
would
fine
attorneys
for
the
two
creditors

time
they
referred
to
each
other
with
terms
such
as
``

``

It
's
still
unclear
whether

wants
to
completely
overhaul

just
tighten

screws
here

there

Largely
to

reduced

The
coupling
of
the
law
firm
and
the
Washington
Legal
Foundation
is
odd
also
,
because
Wilmer
Cutler
was
one
of
the
firms
singled
out

two

by
the
conservative
legal
group
for
displaying
a

the

exceeded
some

.

But
Congress
and
the

accept
no
responsibility
for
the
exercise
of
the
power
they
have
given
the

And
when
any
component
of
the
market
--
cash
,
futures
or
options
--
loses
liquidity
,
the
price
discovery
system
(
the
way
prices
are
determined
)
becomes
flawed

is
lost
entirely
for

time

Yet
the

rose
$

Traders
said
program
activity
was

through
most
of

,
however
,
and
Big
Board
volume
dropped
to
155,650,000
shares
from
about
238
million
Tuesday
as
concerns
about
the
potential
for
additional
sharp
swings
in
the
market
kept
other
trading
in
check
.

Republicans
would
try
to
attach
a
capital-gains
provision
to
that
legislation
,
hoping
the
political
popularity
of
its
other

dissuade

So

Satisfying

He
believed

Sterling
was
quoted
at
$
1.5990
,
up
from

1.5920
late
Wednesday
.

He
said
only
that
the

has
not
yet
taken
any
position
on
Eastern

reorganization
plan
and
that
the
two
sides
were
still
negotiating

As
rescue
teams
continued
searching
for
victims
,
hundreds
of
suvivors
accused
the

of
a
feeble
response
following
the

They
thus

.

David
Burnham
,
one
of
the
authors
,
says
fewer
trials
probably
means
a
growing
number
of
plea
bargains
.

But
that
does
n't
necessarily
mean
thrifts
are
discriminating
against
blacks
,
the
agency
said
.

The
pilots
argued
that
this
triggered
a
pay
raise
for

And
a

for
Reliance

which

held

later
reduced
its

,
would

comment
.

The
targeted
audit
groups
include
direct
sellers
--
people
who
sell
cosmetics
,
housewares
and
other
items
door
to
door
or
at
home
parties
--
and
employers
who
label
workers
as
independent
contractors
instead
of
employees
,
to
avoid
the
employer
share
of
payroll
taxes
.

Kemper
officials
declined
to
identify
the
firms
but
acknowledged
a
long-simmering
dispute
with
four
securities
firms
and
said
the
list
of
brokers
it
wo
n't
do
business
with
may
be
lengthened
in
the
months
ahead
.

Another
anti-Turkish
hook
is
the
Islamic
faith
of
the
majority
of
the
Turkish
people
:
Turkey
,
we
are
told
,
is
not
a
Christian
nation
;
its
people
simply
wo
n't
fit
in
with
the

Among
unanswered
questions
are
whether
Mr.
Papandreou
received
$
23
million
of
stolen
Bank
of
Crete
funds
and
an
additional
$
734,000
in
bribes
,
as
contended
;
whether
the
prime
minister
ordered
state
agencies
to
deposit
some
$
57
million
in
Mr.
Koskotas
's
bank
and
then
skim
off
the
interest
;
and
,
what
PASOK
's
cut
was
from
the
$
210
million
Mr.
Koskotas
pinched
.

Mr.
White
also
predicted
a
half-point
cut
in
the
U.S.
discount
rate
in

said
David
Evans

both
resigned
.

However
,
companies
with
few
catastrophe
losses
this
year
and
already
big
buyers
of
reinsurance
are
likely
to
see
their
rates
remain
flat
,
or
perhaps
even
decline
slightly
.

An
official
at
Wako
Securities
said
these
investors
feel
the
need
to
make
quick
profits
,
despite
destabilizing
external
factors
,
such
as
political
uncertainty
tied
to
the
ruling
party
's
fate
at
next
year
's
Lower
House
elections
-
an
event
which
could
directly
affect
the

But
even
that
goal
may
prove
optimistic
.

Having
rejected
central
economic

for
economic
reasons

the

for
fear
of

The
result
last

of
stealing

from
computers
in
the
U.S.

My
mind
was
miles
north

Though
the

framed

it

in
the

said
its

Kemper

,
has
refused

It
's
tempting
to
think
these
defensive
steps
can
be
delayed
until
a
recession
is
clearly
at
hand
.

In

,
he
joined

Most

attributed

neither

Here

It

Many
economists
think
the
rise
in
the
value
of
the
U.S.
dollar
this
year
will
further
crimp
progress
in
trade
,
because
it
makes
exports
more
expensive

imports
cheaper

One
reason

are
said
to
add
volatility
is
that
--
unlike
in

--
people
can
speculate
in

with
little
money
down

it

He
said
he
will
now
consider
those

set
up
absurd
situations
,
detached
from

then
try
to
reason

``
We

said
Jay

,

at

He
added
that
the

for

,
``
but
at
a
level
significantly
lower
than

CalMat

said
it
completed
a

million
sale
of
assets
from
its
Los

area
real

portfolio
for
net
income
of
$

Mr.

said
he
expects
the
new
price
will
be
considerably
lower
,
but
declined
to
specify
a
figure
.

However
,
even
this
admirable
plan
could
become
objectionable
if
the
White
House
gives
in
to
congressional
Democratic
pressure
to
add
to
the
scope
of
the
president
's
initiative
or
to
involve
the
independent
foundation

He
suspects
that

have

perhaps
a

drop
later

However
,
the

include
only
those

that

The
most
arbitrary
of
these

the

A

the

abrupt

But
congressional

blocked
the

from
occurring

The

optimistic

Indeed
,
when

Another
of
Mr.

criticisms
is
that
Bank
lending
has
done
more
harm
than
good
``
by
implanting
the
wrong
incentives
and
deflecting
energy
away
from
economic
development
.
''

Her
view
is
that
stock
prices
have
three
major
props
:
merger
and
buy-out
proposals
,
earnings
and
the
economic
outlook
.

That
reflects
the
huge
drop
a
week
ago
Friday
,
last
Monday
's
rebound
and
the
dips
and
blips
that
followed
.

In
1807
,
the
Swiss
mathematician
who
headed

U.S.
Coast

made

meter
''
that
he
had
brought
from
Europe
the
standard
of
measure
.

In

action
taken

Then
,
too
,
many
individual
investors
lack
the
sturdy
emotional
makeup
professionals
say
is
needed
to
plunge
in

out

the
market

said

However
,
he
stressed
that
the
improvement
depends
on

continued
reduction

Moreover
,
a

contributed

perceptions
that

slowed

that

3.44

Still

they

high

The
announcement

The

of

``

invented
a
language
called
Newspeak
that
made
it

to
fully

that

anything
negative

According
to
individuals
familiar
with
the
situation
,
the
Frankfurt
loss
stemmed
from
a
computer
program
for
calculating
prices
on
forward-rate
agreements
that
failed
to
envision
an
interest-rate
environment
where
short-term
rates
were
equal
to
or
higher
than
long-term
rates
.

On

And
senior
officials
of

U.S.

houses
say
they

That
approach
flopped
:

If
the

is
as
successful
as
some
expect
,
it
may
do
much
to
restore

``
That
's
a
clear

that
there
is

says
Mr.

of

.

The

6,000
customers

according
to
one
analyst
,
had
1988

of
about
$
85

.

Some
analysts
note
that
after
last
week
's
stock
market
tailspin
and
Tuesday
's
California
earthquake
,
it
's
hard
to
gauge
where
the
central
bank
wants
the
key
federal
funds
rate
.

With
more
than
300
billion
rubles
in

accounts
and
little
to
spend
them
on
,
Soviet
consumers
grumble
at
the
exorbitant
black-market
prices
for
such
goods
--
but
they
buy
them
anyway
.

Asset-backed

The
move
followed
a
round
of

by
other
lenders
against

loans
,
reflecting
a
continuing
decline
in

For

said
that

inevitably
will
go
lower
now
that
they

fallen

Rochester
Telephone
Corp.
said
it
completed
its
purchase
of
Urban
Telephone
Corp.
,
of
Clintonville
,
Wis.
,
the
second-largest
unaffiliated
independent
telephone
company
in
that
state
.

Does
this
corporation
have
a
high-quality
management
team
with
a
good
track
record
?

Carl
Ericson
,
who
runs
the

says
the

jacked
up

The

clumps

Tokyu

advanced
260

Estimated
and
actual
results
involving

are
omitted
.

But
should
they
spy
one
,
the
company
will
pay
a
bonus
equal
to
one-third
its
value
.

Instead
,
they
map
out
a
strategy
in
several
phases
from
now
until
1995
.

The
retail
participation
dropped
to
an
average
18.2
%
in
1988
,
and
shriveled
to
barely
14
%
some
months
during
the
year
.

The
last
time
that
traders
experienced
a
trough
was
during
1985-86
,
when
Beijing
imposed
tough
measures
to
curb
imports
and
conserve
foreign
exchange
.

Nicaragua
's
Defense
Ministry
said
a

``
What
's

doing

hissed
my

and
whose

were

Dean
Steinkuhler
,
a
spectacularly

confesses
that

The
exchanges
contend
that
dual
trading
improves
liquidity
in
the
markets
because
traders
can
buy
or
sell
even
when
they
do
n't
have
a
customer
order
in
hand
.

Meanwhile
,
another
big
Wall
Street
brokerage
firm
joined
others
that
have
been
pulling
back
from
program
trading
.

When
his
Seventh
Avenue
fur
business
here
was
flying
high
20
years
ago
,
Jack
Purnick
had
25
workers
and
a
large
factory
.

``
I
do
n't
know
anybody
in
the
industry
who
has
n't
experienced
litigation
,
''
he
says
.

But
last
month
new
construction
in
all
types
of
homes
waned
,
from
single-family
houses
to
large
apartment
complexes
.

Two
junk
bond
issues
were
priced
yesterday
,
including
a
scaled-backed
offering
by
Beatrice
Co
.

The
recent
outcry
over
program
trading
will
cast
a
pall
over
the
stock-fund
environment
in
the
coming
months
,
some
analysts
say
.

But
many
investors
remain
wary
about
stocks
,
partly
because
they
expect
continued
turbulence
in
the
junk-bond
market
that
would
make
it
more
difficult
to
finance
corporate
takeovers
.

Step
2
will
answer
the
question
:
What
happens
if
these
increases
do
not
materialize
?

The
producers
,
he
says
,
did
a
good
job
of
depicting
someone
``
who
had
done
so
much
,
but
who
was
also
a
manic-depressive
.

Mr.
Sagan
,
a
former
publisher
and
real
estate
developer
,
has
put
together
an
$
8
million
financial
package
that
includes
approximately
$
4
million
of
tax
exempt
bonds
issued
by
the
State
of
Illinois
(
the
first
time
that
a
state
has
used
its
educational
facilities
authority
to
support
construction
of
a
theater
)
,
and
approximately
$
1
million
in
grants
from
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
,
the
MacArthur
Foundation
,
and
a
few
other
deep
pockets
.

Remember
those
bulky
,
thick-walled
refrigerators
of
30
years
ago
?

``
Wage
increases
and
overall

increases

beginning
to
curl
upward
a
little
bit

said
Audrey

labor
economist
at
the
Conference
Board
,
a
business
research
organization
.

``
On
the
close
''
can
be
added
to
many
types
of

.

BUELL
INDUSTRIES
Inc.
halved
its
quarterly
dividend
to
five
cents
a

,
payable
Nov.

to

Nov.

.

The
remainder
of
the
house
leans
precariously
against
a
sturdy
oak
tree
.

All
of
the
firms
except
Kidder
,
which
is
the
second-biggest
program
trader
on
Wall
Street
,
quickly
announced
pull-backs
from
index
arbitrage
.

As
a
result
,
Canada
's
trade
surplus
with
the
U.S.
narrowed
to
C$
656.5
million
(
US$
558

)
in

from
C$
1.23

``
Without

,
it
's
going

difficult
to
win

back

''

Sadly
,
the
cycle
appears
not
as
waves
but
as
a
downward
spiral
.

The
rest
,
as
they
say
,
is
history
.

``
This
means
Nestle
is
now
in
the
candybar
business

Lisbeth
Echeandia

(
True

a
succession
of

.

And
although
Mr.

,
have
gone
out
of

``

``
We

the

Its

Brink
's
operating
profit
was
about
flat
with
the
year-earlier
period
,
reflecting
continued
pricing
and
cost
pressures
.

The
jump
reflected
record

in

,
N.J.
,
as
well
as
a

Laughlin
,

A

for

quick

he

Meanwhile

President

ordered

Moreover
,
just
as

has
acquired
an
upscale
image
in

bourbon

become

Technology
stocks
bore
the
brunt
of
the
OTC
market
's
recent
sell-off
,
and
traders
say
it
's
natural
that
they
rebound
sharply
now
that
the
market
has
turned
around
.

Some
71
%
had
bought
some

;
only
57

had
sold
any

As
Ms.
Johnson
stands
outside
the
Hammack
house
after
winding
up
her
chores
there
,
the
house
begins
to
creak
and
sway
.

The
best
course
for
individual
investors
is
to
sell
these
stocks
now
,
the
two
advisers
say
.

It
's
a
bizarre
and
totally
inappropriate
reaction
,
all
to
add
more
pizzazz
to
a
script
that
's
already
overdosing
on
pizzazz

Avondale

But
unequal
trading
rules
allow
the
futures
market
to
trade
differently
from
stocks
,
which
invites
frequent
bouts
of
stock-index
arbitrage
in
the
first
place
.

Since

expanded

The
rich
image
of
Newport

also
helps
lend
the

artists

air
of
respectability
.

All
this
illustrates
that
Japanese
ministries
still
have
a
``
provider
''
mentality
;
they
do
not
serve
the
people
,
and
particularly
not
consumers

Major
European
auction

an
offered
price
of
30

while
the
10
3\/4

being

for
at

Anyway
,
ZBB
's
procedures
were
so
cumbersome
that
everyone
involved
was
crushed
under
a
burden
of
marginalia
.

Although
the
action
removes
one
obstacle
in
the
way
of
an
overall
settlement
to
the
case
,
it
also
means
that
Mr.
Hunt
could
be
stripped
of
virtually
all
of
his
assets
if
the
Tax
Court
rules
against
him
in

did
n't
surprise
analysts
who
said
the
Pittsburgh

had
been
predicting
a
slow

of

Traders
are
likely
to
oppose

trading
provides
a
way
to
make
money

While

this

wisdom
