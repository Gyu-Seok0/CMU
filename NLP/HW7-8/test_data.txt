The
current
trough
is
expected
to
be
much
deeper
,
because
Beijing
has
cut
off
domestic
funds
from
factories
for
the
first
time
to
slow
inflation
.

Already
,
the
consequences
are
being
felt
by
other
players
in
the
financial
markets
--
even
governments
.

The
officials
also
said
the
meeting
agreed
to
continue
treating
China
as
a
special
case
,
despite
the
recent
repression
of
dissent
there
,
but
to
offer
no
further
concessions
.

The
most
common
conflict
involves
compensation
.

Proponents
of
simplification
fear
that
the
chances
of
getting
it
into
the
final
bill
are
waning
.

That
the
membership
number
has
even
kept
close
to
its
1976
size
is
the
result
of
the
``
graying
''
of
the
church
.

In
a
generation
or
two
some
of
the
New
Crowd
may
attain
true
respectability
,
perhaps
to
be
displaced
in
turn
by
a
later
flock
of
unscrupulous
raptors
.

In
order
to
defuse
pressure
for
an
amendment
,
Mr.
Mitchell
and
House
Speaker
Thomas
Foley
(
D.
,
Wash
.
)
had
arranged
for
lawmakers
to
pass
a
statute
barring
flag
desecration
before
voting
on
the
constitutional
change
.

And
with
the
company
's
recent
announcement
that
it
is
contemplating
a
partial
sale
of
its
real
estate
,
the
values
suddenly
look
poorer
.

A
proposed
conflict-of-interest
policy

His
message
is
getting
a
chilly
reception
in
Detroit
,
where
the
Big

auto

are
already
being
forced
to
close
plants
because
of
soft

and
reduced

The
``
omnibus
''
bill
coming
out
of
Congress
may
be
unwholesome
glop
,
but
the
assorted
chefs
are
happy
and
the
restaurant
is
pushing
the
dish
very
hard
.

No
doubt
many
of
his
ideas
are
worthy
,
but
ultimately
he
is
proposing
to
make
fundamentally
flawed
programs
work
slightly
more
fairly
and
efficiently
.

The
value
traded
on
the
exchanges
is
close
to
$
3
trillion
.

He
adds
:
``

A

have
crossed

to
U.S.

,
according
to
filings
with
the
Securities

Commission
.

And
he
managed
to
fend
off
further
advances
and
even
strike
up
an
unlikely
friendship
with

But
the
actual

of

is
likely
to
be
muddied
by
the

In
fact
,
however
,
Mr.
Reagan
's
casual
debasement
of
the

he
so
recently
held
raises
issues
about

Americans

Under

As

asked
during

does
anyone
seriously
believe
that

Congress
would
have
rushed
to

Security
consultant
Dennis
Dalton
of
Ventura

thinks
mergers
often
trigger
longer
lunch
hours
and
increased
absenteeism

conduct
which
can
sap
the
bottom
line
more
than
thefts
.

But
as
advertisers
latch
onto
disasters
with
increasing
frequency

they
risk
hurting
themselves
as
much
as
helping
the
cause

Yes

But
investors

are
preoccupied

may
be
paying

another

generating
enough
money

no

The
studies
have
reported
repeaters
in
their

I
'm
not
prepared
in
any
case
to
put
that
much
money
into
a
policy
immediately
,
so
I
look
into
the
broad
category
called
universal
life
.

So
far
this
year
,
534,000
newly
built
homes
have
been
sold
,
down
4.5
%
from
the
like
months
of
1988
.

Justin

,
Charles

,
pending
an
expedited
appeal

The

Mortgage
Corp.
issued

backed
by

securities
.

Now
it
's
getting
downright
dangerous
.

Today
,
the
Treasury
Department
will
sell
$
15.6
billion
of
three-month
and
six-month
bills
at
the
regular

auction
.

It
does
n't
have
to
be
a
disaster
.

It
was
also
at
Juilliard
that
Mr.
McDuffie
discovered
his
predilection
for
conservative
,
20th-century
American
composers
such
as
David
Diamond
and
Samuel
Barber
.

The
new
U.S.
package
also
says
countries
could
temporarily
raise
tariffs
on
certain
products
if
they
experience
an
unusually
heavy
volume
of
imports
.

Enron
Corp.
said
a
subsidiary
and
two
United
Kingdom
firms
are
studying
the
feasibility
of
constructing
a
1,500
megawatt
gas-fired

plant
in

Ducks
are
this

for

,
under
OMB
Director
Richard

that

Istat
said
a
national
survey
during
the
first
week
of
July
showed
the
number
of
job
seekers
was
2,888,000
up
from
2,822,000
in
April
,
and
from
2,853,000
a
year
ago
.

But
Citicorp
has
lost
some
credibility
because
it
also
led
the
unsuccessful
effort
to
gain
bank
loans
for
the
labor-management
group
.

For
example
,
if
a
company
posted
a
loss
of
$
100
million
from
buy-out
interest
payments
,
the
existing
rule
would
allow
the
concern
to
be
able
to
receive
a
refund
from
the
tax
it
paid
from
1986
through
1989
,
when
it
may
have
been
a
profitable
public
company
.

``
Frankly
,
I
missed
my
family
,
''
said
Mr.
Rosenblatt
.

In
1988
,
for
example
,
Boston
Co.
had
an
estimated
pretax
profit
of
at
least
$
110
million
,
while
Shearson
managed
net
income
of
just
$
96
million
.

A
survey
of
54,000
of
them
conducted
by
the
IAFP
in
April
showed
that
these
practitioners
alone
had
controlled
or
guided
the
investment
of
$
154
billion
of
their
clients
'
money
in
the
previous
12
months
.

Unlike
the
quarter
's
results
,
which
were
based
on
roughly
equal
shares
outstanding
,
nine-month
per-share
figures
reflect
an
increase
in
average
common
shares
outstanding
to
51.9
million
from
47
million
.

Buying
income
in
real
dollars
actually
increased
15
%
between
1983
and
1987
(
the
most
recent
year
available
)
.

But
here
is
where
the
entrepreneur
made
a
very
risky
bet
,
and
where
society
was
maybe
foolish
to
look
the
other
way
.

At
EDS
,
third-quarter
profit
jumped
16
%
to
a
record
$
110.9
million
,
or
93
cents
a
share
,
from
$
95.9
million
,
or
79
cents
a
share
.

``
There
is

any

''
says
Rep.
Thomas
Downey
(

.

``

The

hurt
by
a
$
289
million
rate
reduction
that
went
into
effect
in
1989
.

The

said
the

Such
sudden
cultural

may
come
across
as
a

forced
,
but
they
seem
to
be
genuine
--
so
much
so

that
some

Last

Overall
,
the

contends
that

largely
were
intended
to
``
curry
favor
''
with
Pentagon
officials
without
detailing
the

allegedly
pervasive
billing
irregularities
uncovered

Despite

Nissan
had
29
%
of
the
Japanese
car
market
in
1980
before
beginning
a
depressing
eight-year

that
continued
through
last

The
NFL
Players
Association
,
meanwhile
,
contends
that
athletes
are
paid
a
wage
commensurate
with
their
ability
to
draw
fans
,
and
that
some
owners
are
in
financial
trouble
because
of
poor
business
management
,
not
players
'
salaries
.

West
Germany
's
biggest

,
IG

,
said
it
is
ready
to
back

for

with
strikes
against
the
nation
's
automotive
,
steel
and
engineering
industries

How
can
we
turn
this
situation
around
?

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
,

industry
executives
said
the

were
sold

Mr.

,
the

believes
that

Columbia

also
said
the
thrift
should

face
problems
meeting

stiffer
regulatory

And
then

now

Adler
Cohen

He
said
the
company
was
``
encouraged
by
feedback
''
it
received
from
selected
customers
now
testing
Version

.

But
he
says
he
did
n't
understand
he
was
buying
the
CD

,
and
he
contends
his
broker
never
fully
explained
the

For

,
and
an

at

of

would
tell

Until

Mr.

the

How
difficult
it
is
for
a
thinking
person
to
live
among
societies
rooted
in
the

Let
's
put
it
bluntly
.

Two
left-wing
politicians
,
Socialist
Leonel
Brizola
,
a
former
governor
of
Rio
de

state
,
and
Marxist-leaning
Luis
Inacio

,

,
Paulo
Salim
Maluf
,
a
former
governor
of
the
state
of
Sao
Paulo
,
and
Guilherme
Afif
Domingos
.

Along
the
way
,
we
're
introduced
to
the
supporting
cast
:
a
blond
bombshell
secretary
(
Randi
Brazen
--
her
real
name
,
honest
)
,
a
scheming
young
boss
(
Fredric
Lehne
)
,
another
blonde
bombshell
who
's
also
an
idealistic
lawyer
(
Lindsay
Frost
)
,
and
a
forensics
expert
(
Charles
Siebert
)
.

He
should
do
more
to
reduce
tax
rates
on
wealth
and
income
,
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
those
cuts
yield
higher
,
not
lower
,
revenues

decisions
until
the
takeover
was
completed

The
software
conversion
costs
would
dwarf
any
savings

His
resignation
follows
a
hostile
takeover
of
the
ad
agency
in
May
by
WPP
of
Britain
.

If
the
whole
story
were
told
,
it
would
read
something
like
this
:

The
government
sought
a
criminal

``
no

never
gets

recovery

Federal

told
Congress

Although

the
headquarters
of
Christian
leader
Aoun
to
support
his
rejection
of
a

plan
approved
Sunday
by

.

The
protesters
said
their
actions
were
justified
by
the

to
save

In

of
HHS
Secretary

,

could

damage

The

also
would
be
tougher
on
the

said

But
,
I
have
to
tell
you
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conceptual

is
flawed

the

is
not

work

Indexing

the
most
part
has
involved
simply
buying

to
mirror
a

barometer
,
such
as
Standard

,
and
match
its

.

Mr.
Blinder
said
the
change
was
n't
related
to
the
brokerage

recent
troubles
,
which
have
included
sharp
declines
in

,
run-ins
with

Metropolitan
Detroit
was
written
off
economically
during
the
early
1980s
,
as
the
domestic
auto
industry
suffered
a
serious

depression
and
adjustment

exchange
the

for
new

he
saw
that
fur
workers
in
many
foreign

willing

were
more
open

that

Rather
,
the
two
closely
linked

have
been
drifting
apart

some
years

a
nearly
five-year-old

on
new
dual

,
separate

different
listing
requirements
,
differing
trading

Treasury

say
the

Denied
a

on

,
the

was
confronted

a
hard
choice
.

The
offers
come
as
Saatchi
is
struggling
through
the
most
troubled
period
in
its
19-year
history
.

They
are
based
on
dubious
psychological
and
sociological
theories
rather
than
on
educational
experience

``
But
in

But
for
others
,
the
pledges
echo
the
promises
made
after
the
1987
stock
crash
,
when
similar
problems
led
many
markets
to
develop
the
new
systems
that
performed
so
badly
last

Senate

traded
proposals
aimed
at
speeding
action
on

to
narrow
the

and
raise
the
federal

but
the
major
stumbling
block
remains
President

SKF

Since
the

decided

who
urged
him
to
support

transform
the
Soviet
system
and
to
urge
him
to
loosen
his
grip
on
Eastern
Europe

said

No

the

shared
less

.

That
is
the

they

,

climate

a

debts
can
borrow
against
the
assets
of
the
successful
company
it
hopes
to
acquire
in

to

;
second
,
that
standing
behind
AIW
is
a
sinister
consortium

much
bigger
,
shadier

shrewder
foreign
interests
secretly
providing
the
money

between
friendly
Japanese
companies

fiercely
independent
Japanese
corporate
attitudes
repel
most
would-be
acquirers

's
more
,
the
bugs
only
emerge
on
esoteric
applications

he

then
very

abrupt

not

to
disappear

economists
had
predicted
.

Then
,
two
weeks
ago
--
declaring
that
``
I
'm
not
looking
for
any
conflict
over
this
''
--
the
president
said
he
would
consider
a
compromise
to
fund
abortions
for
poor
women
in
cases
of
rape
and
incest
.

The
availability
of
these
drives
,
in
turn
,
boosted
demand
for
laptop
computers
,
whose
usefulness
had
been
limited
because
of
lack
of
storage
.

``
The
supply
is
not
a
constraint
to
the
market
,
''
said
Samuel
Kahan
,
chief
financial
economist
at
Kleinwort
Benson
Government
Securities
Inc
.

While
the
composite
index
lost
less
than
a
third
of
its
year-to-date
gains
in
the
market
's
recent
decline
,
the
technology
group
's
gains
were
more
than
halved
.

So
it
was
with
the
Hiss
case
a
generation
later
,
when
Alger
Hiss
became
a
lightning
rod
for
the
anxieties
of
the
Cold
War
and
conflicting
attitudes
toward
the
New
Deal
he
had
served
.

The
report
was
based
on
a
telephone
survey
of
1,250
low-income
households
across
the
state
,
a
mail
survey
of
major
legal-services
programs
and
on-site
interviews
with
individuals
in
the
field
.

Some
70
%
of
graduates
who
recently
earned
an
M.B.A.
degree
say
they
'd
prefer
to
work
in
or
own
a
small
company
,
yet
most
take
jobs
with
large
concerns
,
says
a
survey
by
the
Foster
McKay
Group
,
a
New
York
recruiting
firm

.

Mr.
Wachtel
points
to
Coca-Cola

as
examples
:
They

It
raises
the
long-cherished
hopes
of
many
Germans
for
reunification
--
a
prospect
that
almost
equally
alarms
political
leaders
in
Moscow
,
Washington
and
Western
Europe
.

The
market
for
reruns
sold
to
local
U.S.
broadcasters
has
been
weak
for
the
past
three
or
four
seasons
.

It
also
had
$
479.7
million
of
past-due
loans
;
its
level
of
reserves
against
those
was
n't
immediately
available
,
though
it
is
believed
to
be
small
.

The
Christmas
quarter
is
important
to
retailers
because
it
represents
roughly
a
third
of
their
sales
and
nearly
half
of
their
profits
.

Lotus
Development
Corp.
has
slashed
the
lag
between
U.S.

Japan
product
introductions
to

A
spokesman
for
Southam
declined
to
comment
on
the
price
the
company
is
seeking
or
on
estimates
of
the
paper

annual
losses
,
which
most
analysts
place
at
between
C$
4
million
and
C$
7
million
.

But
real-estate
experts
and
brokers
said
the
quake
undoubtedly
will
drag
down
prices
in
neighborhoods
built
on
less
stable
ground
,
especially
in
the
Bay
Area
.

The
Turner
move
is
in
line
with
a
cable-TV
trend
toward
more
original
programming
--
and
toward
finding
more
ways
to
amortize
the
high
cost
of
producing
films
.

But
not
all
strategists
or
money
managers
are
ready
to
throw
in
the
towel
completely
on
cyclicals
.

The
1989
deficit
would
have
been
nearly
$
10
billion
larger
had
the
government
been
able
to
spend
as
much
as
Congress
intended
on
cleaning
up
the
thrift
industry
before
the
year
ended
on
Sept.
30
.

But
it
said
the
year-earlier
results
included
gains
of
$
23.5
million
from

.

Officials
familiar
with
the
talks
said
Citicorp
had
discussed
lowering
the
offer
to
$
250
a
share
,
but
said
that
price
was
a
talking
point
and
that
no
decision
has
been
made
.

``

Though
it
's
clear
that
Mr.
Gelbart
's
sympathies
do
not
lie
with
the
far
right
,
it
's
also
true
that
he
is
evenhanded
in
dispensing
his
satirical
jabs
,
taking
sharp
aim
at
senators
and
congressmen
of
all
stripes
and
particularly
at
the
media
.

He
expects
the
price
for
that
product
to
rise
even
more
next

Manufacturers
frequently

as
Clinton
can

Canadian

But

rather
than
a

Forest-products

were
dogged
by

a
strong
Japanese

.

Such
concerns
,

have

Israel
has
long
claimed
Mr.
Arafat
never
meant
to
renounce
terrorism
,
particularly
because
he
and
his
lieutenants
reserved
the
right
to
press
``
armed
struggle
''
against
the
Jewish
state
.

A
federation
official
attributed
the
decline
to
brisk
demand
from
domestic
industries
backed
by
continuing
economic
expansion
in
Japan
.

Part
of
the
problem
,
though
,
may
reflect
a
general
unwillingness
to
work
with
the
urban
poor

Ms.
Davis
said
the
new
machines
could
steal
some

away
from
Olivetti

minicomputers
,
but
would
bring
new
sales
among
professionals
such
as
engineers
,

Analysts

had
mixed
reactions
to

questioning

Analysts
predicted
that
the

would
further
shake
creditor

The
sell-off
in
New

triggered
by
concerns

in

of
the
impending
mayoral
election
.

Consumers
Power
Co.
,
now
the
main
unit
of

,
ran
into
financial
problems
over
its
$
4.2
billion
Midland
nuclear
plant
,
which
was
abandoned
as
a
nuclear
facility
in
1984
because
of
construction
delays
and
high
costs
.

Avondale
was
notified
by
Louisiana
officials
in
1986
that
it
was
potentially
responsible
for
a
cleanup
at
an
oil-recycling
plant

The

said
.

Crude

More
than
half
the
domestic
drilling
now
under

is
for
gas
,
partly
on
the
assumption
that

a
fuel
that
is
cleaner
to

than
either
oil

.

``

One
of
the
reasons
Bush
administration
aides
are
anxious
to
insist
that
the
coming
meeting
will
be
informal
is
to
avoid
comparisons
with
the
last
such
loosely
structured
superpower
gathering
,
former
President
Reagan
's
1986
meeting
with
Mr.

in

The
computer
would
let
the
machine
run
just
until
that
order
was
filled
,
eliminating
waste
.

The
most
striking
example
yesterday
may
have
been
in
community
development
funds
,
where
the
two
houses
had
separately
approved
a
total
of
27
projects
valued
at
$
20
million
,
and
the
conference
added
15
more
valued
at
$
8
million
to
ostensibly
preserve
``
balance
''
between
the
House
and
Senate
.

The
addition
to
reserves
comes
on
top
of
a
provision
of
$
199.7
million
that
was
announced
in
June
.

Unit
volume
,
or
amount
of

rose
about
11

in

continuing
to
win
market
share
in
Japan
's
diaper

markets
.

If
sales
do
n't
pick
up
,
the
cuts
will
go
deeper
and
incentives
will
sprout
again
.

In
the
tender
offer
supplement
,
Dow
Jones
discloses
the
different
growth
forecasts
but
says
it
views
the
20

growth
rate
``
as
a
hoped-for
goal
''
of
Telerate
's
management
``
and
not
as
a
realistic
basis
on
which
to
project
the

Some
analysts
say
Noranda
would
prefer
to
break
up
Falconbridge
,
and
that
the
Swedes
--
relatively
inexperienced
in
international
mining
operations
--
could
have
problems
holding
their
own
with
a
much
bigger
partner
like
Noranda
operating
on
its
home
turf
.

The
buy-out
fell
through
after
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
the
lead
banks
in
the
transaction
,
failed
to
obtain
$
7.2
billion
in
financing
needed
for

.

So
the
IRS
has
drawn
a
rationale
from
the
sale
of
a
home
site
split
in
two
and
sold
in
different
years
to
the
same
buyer
;
a
court
let
the
seller
in
that
old
case
treat
this
as
the
sale
of
one
residence

While
each

only
a
small

together
they
would
erode

Mr.

said
.

As
long
as
we

that
all
Americans
,
of
every
race

cooperatively
,
our

As

There
is
n't
any
way
to
continuously
measure
the
amount
of
tritium
in

so
it

difficult
to
tell
whether
the
tritium
formation
is
related
to
the
heat
bursts

some
other
phenomenon

Before

foreign

set

it
helped
create
him
out
of
the
crucible
of
Panama

long
history
of
conspirators
and
pirates

He
used
to
be

Add
it
all
up

it
means
``

leeway

Upping

could
slow

Needless
to
say
,
it
was
an
interesting
first
session
!

The

requires
approval
from

from

In
one
sense
,
this
limits
him
;
unlike
a
writer
such
as
Gabriel
Garcia
Marquez

distinctive
Latin

Mr.

But
traders
on
the
exchange
floor
,
who
can
observe
the
computer-guided
trading
activity
on
monitor
screens
,
said
most
of
the
top
program-trading
firms
were
active
both
days

Since

the

has
undertaken
a
major

many
industry

However

there

New

Westborough

,
has
proposed
buying
the

2

would

$

Recruited
from
New

University
's
MBA
program
,
he
rose
within
two
years
to
head
of
production
,
overseeing
such
films
as
``

``
Taxi

``

and
``

In
addition
,
the
group
says
some
of
its
member
companies
have
been
denied
insurance
because
individual
workers
had
medical
problems
that
ranged
from
a
mild
cardiac
condition
to
psychological
counseling
after
a
divorce
,
hemorrhoids
and
overweight

The

he
expressed
confidence
that
the
proposed
new
company
's
cash
flow
would
be
sufficient
to
cover

payments

debt
,
he
estimated
that
the
company
would
n't
be
profitable
until
1994
or
later

Rebuilding
that
team
,
Mr.
Lee
predicted
,
will
take
another
10
years

I
saw
neither

These
apocalyptic
predictions
were
advanced
by

Mr.

expects

tax
treatment

capital
gains
.

That
would
send

plummeting

some
gun-shy
U.S.

executives
still
regard
as
too
low
a
level
