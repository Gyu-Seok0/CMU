BankAmerica
Corp.
reported
a
34
%
jump
in
third-quarter
earnings
,
as
its
rocket-like
recovery
from
nearly
ruinous
losses
several

continued
to
be
fueled
by
growth
in
consumer

,
higher

A

Mr.

General

and
automotive
electronics
unit
,
GM
Hughes
Electronics
,
said
net
income
fell
22
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
reflecting
declining
military
spending
and
slumping
GM
vehicle
production
.

But
he
said
that
even
under

conditions
,
the

still
would
realize
a
savings
of
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
the
first

He
probably
did
n't
penetrate

the

they

Some
younger
pilots
say
they
have
had
to
endure
anti-union
harangues
by
senior
pilots
while
flying
across
the
country
.

The
rates
of
increase
,
however
,
are
less
than
the
rapid
growth
of
the
boom
years
,
and
this
has
resulted
in
a
loss
of
confidence
in

The

When

lost

election
,
following
Mrs.

hated
emergency

a

took
power
and
then
disintegrated
.

Mr.
Falls
kept
the
form
,
but
Americanized
it
with
Mr.
Bartlett
's
further
help
.

Some
of
it
was
due
to
lower-than-expected
earnings
from
leading
companies
,
he
said
.

Lotus
's
results
were
about
10

higher

average

compared
favorably

the
36

rise
reported
a
day
earlier
by

The

As
Jaguar

Britain

,
Ford
could
turn
up
the
heat
by
convening
a
special
shareholders

meeting
and
urging

to
drop
the
limits
early

Jumping
in
on
big
deals
is
a
high
profile
way
to
leapfrog
the
problem
of
not
having
a
strong
retail-banking
network

AT&T
already

a
factory
in
Matamoros
,
Mexico
,
to
make

devices

in

``

At
the

,
the

said
it

recalling
one
of

had
stopped

Both

thousand

President

insists
it
would
be
a
great
tool
for
curbing
the
budget
deficit
and
slicing
the
lard
out

government
programs
.

``
The
rest
will
probably
not
be
recoverable
either
because
the
statute
of

expired

Edward
J.
Campbell
,
economist
at

,
New

,
noted
that
large

activity

efforts
could
offset
loss
of
production
in
those
areas

In

signed
two

more

Soviet

Because
of
the
interest
connected
with
the
issue
,
the
London

took
the
unusual
step
of
letting

But
ever

seemingly
has
tried
just

hard
to
avoid

pressed

From
a
reading
of
the
somewhat
scant
English-language
medical
literature
on
RU-486
,
the
French
abortion
pill
emerges
as
one
of
the
creepiest
concoctions
around
.

Despite
the
tragic
loss
of
more

and
damage
estimated
in

most

Never

Today
a
President
can
still
send

they
're
meaningless

changes

Yesterday

began
after

Foreclosures

in

Both
candidates
are
negotiating
about
holding
debates
,
but
Mr.
Dinkins
is
widely
seen
as
the
major
obstacle
for
scheduling
them
.

Meanwhile
,
they
tackle
the
mounds
of
paper
--
and
fantasize
about
a
dream
world
where
bulk-mail
postal
regulations
and
government
inspectors
are
banished
.

The

did
n't
make
a
formal

,
but
instead
told
UAL

before
the

that
it
was
working
on
a

valued
at
between
$
225

``

a

Then
,
as

the

AT&T

And
the

hit

The

also
said
that
the
number
of
fattened

explained
,

Computer

familiar
with

flaws

found
in

say
the

are
likely

be

up

,
says

this

The

Department
proposed
that

This
is
an
ominous
sign
for

Companies

The

after

out
of

Winnebago
said
it

The

expected

helps
the

In

further
distinguished
the

the
anti-nausea

Surviving
scandal
has
become
a
rite
of
political
passage
at
a
time
when
a
glut
of
scandal
has
blunted
this
town
's
sensibility
.

The
local
government
is
discredited
in
the
eyes
of
many
residents
for
a
variety
of
reasons
,
and
congressmen
read
the

watch

Treasury
Undersecretary
David

The
filing
,
made
yesterday
in

here
,
follows
an

by

Merksamer

,
to
sell
the

to
management
for
an
undisclosed

A
number
of
major
banks
have
posted
big
losses
after
sharply
increasing
loan-loss
reserves
.

But
even
a
Japanese
company
that
looks
like
a
dog
may
turn
out
to
be
a
good
investment
for
a
foreign
concern
,
some
management
consultants
maintain
.

A
retired
electrical
engineer
we
'll
call
Ben
works
part-time
as
a
consultant
,
but
he
does
n't
want
to
earn
so
much
that
Social
Security
reduces
his
benefits
.

Along
the
way
,
Mr.
Tharp
omitted
a
total
of
$
1.5
million
from
his
receipts
reported
on
federal
tax
returns
for
three
years
.

Both
companies
are
conservative
marketers
that
rely
on
extensive
market
research
.

And
that
is
before
consideration
of
increased
state
and
local
revenues
from
taxes
and
fees
on
sales
,
real
estate
,
licenses
and
the
like

,
ended
little
changed

And
while
the
defense
secretary
is
speaking
out
,
President

himself
has
n't
launched
any

Conference
attendees
are
expected
to
be
buzzing
about
the
workings
of
the
recently
formed
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
a
federal
agency
charged
with
disposing
of
an
estimated
$
200

of
real

dumped
in

hands
by

The
project
appeared
to
be
on
the
rocks
earlier
this
month
when
the
other
major
partner
in
the
project
,
China
General
Plastics
Corp.
,
backed
out
.

For
a
while
,
it
looked
like
the
deal
--
not
to
mention
the
courtroom
itself
--
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
.

Earlier
this
month
,
the
Reserve
Bank
of
New

,
the
country
's
central

,
appointed
the
managers
to
run
the
investment
bank
and
pay
creditors
.

The
board
's
decision
,
announced
after
the
market
closed
Monday
,
initially
prompted
a
severe
sell-off
in
UAL
shares
,
which
at
midday
traded
as
low
as
$
145
a
share
,
down
$
33
a
share
,
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

The
increase
follows
the
company
's
report
of
strong
earnings
for
the
third
quarter
,
and
reflects
what
American
Brands
called
its
``
tradition
of
sharing
earnings
growth
''
with
shareholders
.

A

State

stopped

it

Western
tourists
in

says
Deputy

Even
when
new
lending
resumes
,
foreign
exchange
would
still
be
tight
because
Beijing

likely
try

Predictions
for
limited
dollar
losses
are
based
largely
on
the
pound
's
weak
state
after
Mr.
Lawson
's
resignation
and
the
yen
's
inability
to
strengthen
substantially
when
there
are
dollar
retreats

Mr.
Pilson
recalls
that
in
April
1986
,
after
CBS
's
annual
meeting
in
Philadelphia
,
he
and
Mr.
Tisch
took
the
90-minute
train
ride
back
to
New
York
,
and
Mr.
Pilson
used
this
extended
private
audience
to
outline
his
ambitions
.

The
company
also
cited
the
stronger
dollar
,
which
cuts
the
value
of
overseas
profit
when
it
is
translated
into
dollars
.

We

Mr.

Like
Brecht
,
and
indeed
Ezra
Pound
,
Ms.
Bogart
has
said
that
her
intent
in
such

is
simply
an
attempt
to
``
make

Banks

Separately
,
AT&T
filed
a
countersuit
against
MCI
accusing
it
of
misleading
consumers
through
allegedly
``
false
and
deceptive
''
advertising
.

``
We
're
meeting
and
surpassing
our
goals
,
''
he
added
.

With
interest
in
emigration
and
investment
abroad
soaring
since
June
4
,
that
assumption
no
longer
seems
so
safe
.

But
in
the
case
of
the
Nimitz
Freeway
,
the
lack
of
such
support
caused
the
core
of
the
columns
to
crumble
and
buckle
under
the
weight
of
the
second
deck
,
crushing
motorists
who
were
lined

will
have

be
subtracted

But
agreement
aparently
could
n't
be
reached
because
of

because

years
ago
,
it
seemed
like
the
company
had
pulled
the
plug
on
its
century-old
power
generation
business
.

Over
the
last
20
years
,
for
example
,
Mr.
Brouwer
says
,
an
investor
putting
$
5,000
a
year
in
the
S&P
500
would
have
made
nearly
twice
as
much
than
if
it
were
invested
in
Treasury
bills
.

The
company
said
it
estimates
the
Desert
Inn
remodeling
will
cost
about
$
32
million
,
and
the
refurbishment
of
the
three
DC-8-62
aircraft
,
made
by
McDonnell
Douglas
Corp.
,
will
cost
around
$
24.5
million
.

Mr.

were
indicted
last

For
the
real

industry
,
a
watchword
for
the
1990s
will
be
buy
,
more
than
build
.

The

will
pay
the
modest
1

Like

Mr.

has
turned
cynic
.

Sung
Won
Sohn
,
chief

at
Norwest
Corp.
,
Minneapolis
,
holds
that
the
recent
stock-market
volatility
``
increases
the
possibility
of
economic
recession

reinforces
the
bad

''
from
recent

independent
display
in

boxy

Critics
say
Mitsubishi

's
decision
to
buy

reflects
the
degree
to
which

are
irritated

Federal

officials
sent
another
signal
of
their
determination
to
shore
up
investor
confidence
.

The
transmogrified
brokers
never
let
the
C-word
cross
their
lips
,
instead
stressing
such
terms
as
``
safe
,
''
``
insured

and
``
guaranteed
''
--
even
though
these
terms
may
be
severely
limited

Britain

Until

But
Costa

officials
argue
that
the
recent
drop
in
coffee
prices
,
combined
with
the
country
's
continuing
struggle
to
reinvigorate
its
economy
,
make
the
support
as
necessary
as
ever
.

Mobil
officials
said
they
have
been
studying
ways
of
streamlining
these
operations
since
early
this

Product

,
however
,
have
left

buffeted
by
harsher

,
as

But
this
week
,
B.A.T
has
been
hit
harder
than
other
big
U.K.
stocks
--
first
by
the
market
gyrations
,
then
by
Tuesday
's
San

earthquake
,
which
could
leave

facing
big

Mr.

,

the

to

accused

Desperately

He
said
more
than
70
%
of
the

unit
voted
in
favor
of

.

In
two
of
three
years
,
the
actual
result
should
fall
within
that
range
if
all
the
assumptions
were
accurate
.

But
that
deal
fell
through
in
September
after
it
became
clear
that
the
sale
would
lead
to
a
major
real
estate
tax
reassessment
,
raising
property
taxes
,
and
making
it
difficult
to
lease
the
building
at
competitive
prices
.

Last

the

American

's

Reuben

Colgate-Palmolive
Co.
,
said
he
is
``

''
with
analysts
'
estimates
that
third-quarter
earnings
rose
to
between
95
cents
and
$
1.05
a
share
.

The
company
blamed
a
number
of
factors
for
the
earnings
decline
,
including
softer
sales
of
joint-implants
.

The
quarter
net
was
below
analyst
expectations
mainly
because
truck-parts
sales
did
n't
rebound
in
September
from
the
summer
doldrums
as
they
usually
do
,
said
Patrick
E.
Sheridan
,
analyst
with

Life
insurers
fared
similarly
,
with
Legal

General
advancing
3
to

,
although
Prudential
fell
2
to

The
additional
spending
pushes
the
measure
more
than
$
2
billion
above
its
prescribed
budget
ceiling
,

the

Appropriations

of

today

But
the

led

precarious

The

has

forecast
full-year
earnings
for
1989
,
although
it
said
that
its
first-half

are
n't
a
good
indication
because
of
one-time
elements
and
the
seasonal
nature

its

Much
of

Like
many
others
,
Mr.
Kaye
took
notice
in
1987
when
Sony
,
in
a
classic
example
of
market
segmentation
,
changed
the
plastic
skin
and
buttons
on
the
famous
Walkman
line

created

The
problem
,
says
Mr.

,
a
psychologist
,
is
that
``
it
's
very
hard
to
get
any
hard
measures

affects

One
analyst
said
he
thought
the

caused
by
adverse
weather

Avoiding
failure
is
easy
.

``

'm
not

that

,
it
would
be
the
earliest
that
country
had
made
purchases

the
1979-80

thus
would
be
a
bullish
sign

Many
of

even
dropping
their
traditional
independence

trying
to
band
together
to
create
some
sort

Today
should
be
interesting
as
people
realize
how
hard
life
is
going
to
be
here
for
a
while
.

Such
trappings
suggest
a
glorious
past
but
give
no
hint
of
a
troubled
present
.

But
the
delay
could
happen
if

says
one

,
higher

narrows
the

widens
it

South
are
entering
the
critical
Christmas
shopping
season
with
more
momentum
than
those
in
other
regions
.

The
transaction
is
expected
to
close
by
Nov.
30
.

Yesterday
,
Compaq
plunged
further
,
closing

When
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
travels
to
Poland
Nov.

,
he
is
expected
to
take
with
him
a
promise
of
three
billion
West
German
marks
(
$
1.6
billion
)
in
new
credit
guarantees
for
industrial

So
she
has
agreed
to
forgo
monetary
damages
against
Mr.

.

``
This

said
Allan
McGuire
,
a

Thrifts
continued
to
shed
assets
in

,
mainly
to
comply
with
stiffer

under
the

New
England
Electric
values
its

at

One
of
them
,
25-year-old
Markus
Hess
of
Hannover
,
allegedly
used
the
international
telecommunications
network
to
break
into
more
than
30
high-security
computers
in
the
U.S.
,
searching
for
secrets
.

Meanwhile
,
overall
evidence
on
the
economy
remains
fairly
clouded
.

After
the
payment
,
the
Cleveland
company
owes
$
57
million
on
the
loan
.

Still
,
Westinghouse
acknowledges
that
demand
from
independent
producers
could
evaporate
if
prices
for
fuel
such
as
natural
gas
or
oil
rise
sharply
or
if
utilities
,
which
have
been
pressured
by
regulators
to
keep
down
rates
,
are
suddenly
freed
to
add
significant
generating
capacity
.

Most
of
the
higher
costs
were
associated
with
acquisitions
and
growth
in
nonregulated
business
units

added

He
wants

Still
,
two-thirds
of
the

has
been
steered
into
other
Vanguard
portfolios
,
says
Brian
Mattes
,
a

Mr.

,
the
Massachusetts
grower
,
says
the
``

recently
because
they
were

waxed
and

.

Though
Sir
James
has
said
he
intends
to
mount
a
new
bid
for
B.A.T
once
approval
from
U.S.
insurance
regulators
is
received
,
jitters
over
prospects
for
junk-bond
financing
and
U.S.
leverage
buy-outs
are
making
investors
more
skeptical
about
Sir
James
's
prospects
.

The
market
also
shrugged
off
positive
factors
,
such
as
higher
bond
prices
and
a
slowdown
in
monetary
growth
in
September
,
traders
said
.

Mr.
Cawthorn
attributed
the
decline
in
third-quarter
operating
profit
to
the
stronger
dollar
,
which
reduces
the
value
of
overseas
profit
when
it
is
translated
into
dollars
;
to
accelerated
buying
of
Rorer
products
in
the
second
quarter
because
of
a
then-pending
July
1
price
increase
,
and
to
higher
marketing
expenses
for
Rorer
's
Maalox
antacid
,
whose
sales
and
market
share
in
the
U.S.
had
slipped
in
the
first
half
of
1989
.

Louisiana-Pacific
Corp.
said
its
board
authorized
the
purchase
of
as
many
as
five
million
of
its
common
shares
for
employee
stock
plans
and
other
general
corporate
purposes
.

It
took
me
a
half-hour
to
move
10
feet
from
my
parking
spot
in
an
outer
lot
to
an
aisle
,
and
an
additional
hour
to
reach
an
inner
roadway
a
half-block
away
.

The
group
had
an
operating
profit
of
$
65
million
,
against
a
loss
of
$
13
million
a
year
earlier
.

Then
he
canceled
production
of
the
Navy

most
important

aircraft
,
the

Still
,
Mr.
McCammon
said
Ford
expects
the
U.S.
economy
to
weaken
through
the
end
of
1990
,
causing
weaker
sales
and
production
.

But
,
with
public
demonstrations
in
the
country
growing
in
size
and
intensity
,
Mr.
Honecker
and
several
key
allies
lost
out
in
this
battle
,
officials
say
.

Clean
Harbors
,
based
in
Quincy
,
said
it
``

For

,
the

tax
rate
on

33

from
the
current
top
rate
of

In
a
filing
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
Mr.
Terra
said
he
sold

True
,
Ford
was
declared
the
winner
Sunday
,
but
only
after
the
Honda
driver
who
crossed
the
finish
line
first
was
disqualified
because
it
hit
another
car
and
skid
momentarily
out
of
bounds
.

The
House
seriously
considered
raising
the
top
tax
rate
paid
by
individuals
with
the
highest
incomes
.

The
action
is
a
counterclaim
to
a
suit
filed
by
Alaska
in
August
against
Exxon
and
six
other
oil
companies

The

A
close

suggests
that

has
well-stated
his
views

on
all
sides

Due

For
example
,
the
proposed
overhaul

--
an
extremely
sensitive
political
topic
--
is
far
more
precise
than
the
vague
plans
announced
by
Mr.
Gorbachev
in
1987
and
later
dropped
.

He
predicted
the

will
be
reduced
by
another
A$
3.8
billion
this
fiscal
year
ending
June
30
,
1990

did
n't
explain
how
this
will
be
achieved

Beyond
the
current
weakness
in
the
junk
bond
market
,
banks
have
another
advantage
over
investment
banks
in
financing
contested
takeovers
.

Several
reports
as
the
day
progressed
gave
vague
or
conflicting
indications
about
whether
banks
would
sign
up
.

Mr.

the

representing
a

and

reported
.

Indeed
,
that
happened
to
some
extent
yesterday
,
as
industrial
stocks
rebounded
,
partly
on
news
of
takeovers
in
the
paper

.

He
said
that

scour
the

The
rewriting
was
launched
at
a
meeting
between
Mr.
Bush
and
intelligence
committee
leaders
Oct.
12
,
a
few
days
before
the
meeting
at
which
the
president
complained
about
the
rules
.

According
to
reports
released

October
from
the
previous
month
.

Separately
,
bankers
representing
the
group
trying
to
buy
United

met
with

about

that
purchase
at

even
tested

has
also
arisen
that
the

closely

Mr.
Darman
's
inclination
to
save
the
sequester
was
backed
up
yesterday
by
White
House
Press
Secretary
Marlin
Fitzwater
:

For
the
nine
months
,
America
West

with
a
loss

But
because

Mr.
Finkelstein
flew
to
San

the
day
after
the
earthquake
,
and
found
that
10

12

had
sustained
some
damage
,
including
the
breakage
of
most
windows
at
the

on

It

have
been

among

Whitehall
cited
concerns
about

But
he
has
been
getting
heat
from
all
sides
over
program
trading
.

He
defeated
the
contentious
Mr.
Koch
in
the
Democratic

partly
because
he
seemed
to
offer

racial
and
ethnic
wounds
.

Meanwhile
,
some
currency
traders
at
West
German
banks
in
Frankfurt
said
they
sold
dollars
on
the
news
and
had
to
buy
them
back
later
at
higher
prices
.

Accrued

But
this
is
a
production
designed

directed

Franco
Zeffirelli

no

down

But
Mr.
Lesko
's
staff
is
beginning
to
wonder
whether
there
is
n't
some
larger
phenomenon
foiling
the
contest
.

Last
year
's
results
were
hurt
by
$
41.3
million
in
restructuring
charges
.

But
the
stock
market
swings
have
continued
.

Rather
,
``
It
just
shows
things
have
changed

''

Similar

were
defeated
in
at

Scientists

But
despite
more
than
two
years
of
research
showing
AZT
can
relieve
dementia
and
other
symptoms
in
children
,
the
drug
still
lacks
federal
approval
for
use
in
the

.

And
they
,
or

the

discourage
disaster

in
the
form

That

was
reflected
in

Although
the
economy
showed
no
change
of
pace
from
the
second
quarter
,
many
analysts
expect
it
to
slow
considerably
in
the
fourth
quarter
as
demand
for
autos
falls
,
partly
because
of
higher
prices
on
models
introduced
last
month
.

The
investment
boom
is
mainly
sparked
,
they
say
,
by
strong
domestic
demand
and
is
n't
likely
to
increase
exports
sharply
.

In

But
analysts
focused
more
on
the
drop
in
revenue
,
to
$
1.04
billion
from
$
1.07

,
reflecting
in
part
a
continuing

The

included
a

of

as
a
partial
reversal
of

because
the
reserve
established
last

exceeded
the
actual

costs
.

Though
not
reflected
in
the
table
,
an

should
know
that
the

by
any

Fed

Although

Also
,
concern
exists
that
the
harder-line
Beijing

The
Fed
has
let
interest
rates
slip
slightly
,
but
whether
the
main
reason
was
dollar
intervention
,
the
gloomy
reports
on
manufacturing
employment
,
or
the
Friday

market
drop
,
only
Mr.
Greenspan
and
his
associates
know
.

And
he
indicated
that
more
substantial

is
expected
in

``
Why
we
even
just
sold
a

keep

weak
real-estate

Lone
Ranger
lived

says
David
Rambo
,
a
sales
associate
with
Jon
Douglas
Co.
,
a
Los
Angeles
real-estate
agency

The
statement
angered
Chairman
Greenspan
,
but
it
was
greeted
with
applause
by
the
Bush
administration
and
the
financial
markets

Mr.

American

expect

For
journalists
,
however
,
who
write
what
they
fondly
view
as
history
's
first
draft
,
this
has
also
been
a
week
to
give
a
lot
of
space
and
time
to
Ron
and
Nancy
's
sales
appearance
in
Japan
on

Mr.
Breeden
,
not
missing
a
chance
to
press
his
agenda
,
cited
the
earthquake

As
a
starting
point

here
are
five
propositions

Consider
the
ingredients

not
the
name

J.P.
Morgan
Securities
Inc.
is
offering
the
remaining
$
10
million
of

.

By
the
second
half
of
1990
,
USAir
stock
could
hit
60
,
says
Helane
Becker
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Not
that
getting
into
town
was
easy
.

The
company
,
which
currently
has
13.5
million
common
shares
outstanding
,
said
it
has
no
specific
plans
for
the
shares
.

The
increase
for
national
edition
advertising
is
less
than
the
inflation
rate
and
compares
with
a
6.5
%
increase
in
1989
.

Mr.
Turner
was
troubled
enough
to
cancel
the
U.S.
contract
with
the
rent-a-colonel
at
the
beginning
of
the
Carter
administration
.

Durable
goods
orders
for
September
,

Trying

in

The

invests
heavily
in
dollar-denominated
money-market
securities
overseas
.

``
It
has
difficulties
paying
its
foreign

says
a
Hong

executive
who

grew
almost
8
%

279.8

last
year
.

But
his
first
crop
wo
n't
be
picked
till
next
year
.

But
,
Mr.
Kakita
added
,
once
U.S.
equities
regain
some
stability
,
players
will
move
back
into
dollar-denominated
investments
,
especially
Treasury
bonds
,
whose
value
rises
when
interest
rates
decline

But
by
all
accounts
foreign
companies
have
bought
only
a
relative
handful
of
Japanese
companies
this
year
,
while
Japanese
companies
have
acquired
hundreds
of
foreign
companies
.

But
alleviating
that
overhang
failed
to
stimulate
much
activity
in
the
secondary
market
,
where
prices
were
off
1\/8
to
up
3\/8
point

During

Because
a
purchaser
can
use
an
FHA
loan
to
finance
all
points
and
closing

,
the
FHA
can
wind
up
lending
more
than
a

is
worth

Robert
Pierce

chairman

chief

said

for

In
addition
,
USX
's
giant
steel
segment
,
representing
34
%
of
its
1988
sales

is
facing
softening
demand
and
slipping
prices
as
well
as
increasing
competition
from
foreign
steelmakers
and
low-cost
minimills

In
response
to
a
shareholder
's
suggestion
,
Mr.
Greenberg
agreed
that
European
firms
will
simply
pick
up
the
index-arbitrage
business
left
behind
by
U.S.
institutions

The
company
said
its
real

portfolio
is
``
highly
leveraged

''
while
about
two-thirds
of
its
investments
are
n't
income-producing

Stop

are
sometimes
called
``
stop-loss
''
orders
because
they
are
frequently
used
to
protect
profits
or
limit
losses
.

Instead
,
the
press
corps
readily
accepted
the
notion
that
a
snag
in
the
takeover
financing
of
United
Airlines
instantly
knocked
7
%
off
the
value
of
the
nation
's
capital
stock
and
caused
convulsions
around
the
world
.

Many
takeover
stocks
plunged
Friday
,
as
speculators
retained
their
confidence
in
corporate
buyers
but
fled
from
the

whisper
stocks

the
targets
of
rumored

If
the
matter

The
closeness

The

a

We
are
deeply
disturbed
that
a
recent
editorial
stated
that
the
``
Americans
With
Disabilities
Act
of
1989

was
``
crafted
primarily
by

Combined

The
quake
and
baseball
were

I
find
it

the

reported

Still

Nicaraguan

boosting
spending
on
SDI

when
the

In

One

The
personal
antics
of
agency
Director
Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow
drew
much
attention
,
such
as
when
several
of
his
top
aides
were
uncovered
as
KGB
plants
and
ejected
from
France
and
when
a
mysterious
office
fire
was
set
just
before
Congress
sent
accountants
to
trace

contends
.

It

Looking

he
erred

employing

it
even

they

Three

But
several
weeks

,
in
the
wake
of
the
Beijing
killings
,
the

canceled
,
according
to

close
to

The
question
,
as
many
people
see
it
,
is
how
long
such
uncertainty
will
last
.

``

Foreign
Relations
Committee
who
pushed
to
provide
Costa

about
the

as
it
received
last

.

He
asserts
that
some

who
have
joined

with

founder
James
Patterson
,
have
ties
to
Wendy

,
a
competing
hamburger

Tandem
,
which
already
specializes
in
on-line
transaction
processing
,
is
a
potent
competitor
in
that
market
.

A
private
challenge
to
the
monolithic
tractor
industry
will
take
more
time
and
money
than
Poland
can
spare
,
although
a

or
a
local

can
spring
up
fast
.

But
the
San

finds
itself
asking
that
the
cap
per

be
lifted

500,000
from

100,000
to
assist
the
hard

often
wealthy

The
problem
for
IBM
trial
lawyers
Thomas
Barr

David

was
how
to
make
such
a
highly
technical
case
understandable
.

And
he
has
worked
to
shed
his
raider
image
.

But
Bouygues
said
its
first-half
profit
is
n't
indicative
of
the
full-year
trend
because
of
the
highly
seasonal
nature
of
many
of
the
company
's
activities
.

But
he
warns
that
banks
will
have
``
to
have
enough
discipline
''
not
to
make
loans
that
are
too
risky
.

Since
most
of
the

in
California
,
the

will
be

in
a

development
is
often
held
hostage
to
zoning
boards

But
according
to

is
n't
the
only

For
years
,
we
tried
to
ignore
the
problem
of
poverty
,
and
now
that
it
has
gotten
out

it
's
a
new
crusade
for
the
media
and
our
Democratic
Congress
.

That
they
retain
Korean
citizenship
and
ties
is
a
reflection
of
history
--
their
parents
were
shipped
in
as
laborers
during
the
decades
when
Japan
occupied
Korea
before
World
War
II
--
and
the
discrimination
that
still
faces
Koreans
in
Japanese
society
.

interests
in
military
electronics
and
electro-optics
,
marine
transportation
and

.

That
analysis
matches
up
with
stock
traders
'
reports
that
,
despite
the
huge
drop
in
the

,
UAL
has
n't
returned
to
the
level
at
which
it
could
attract
buying
by
institutions
solely
on
the
basis
of
earnings
.

The
new
understanding
did
n't
just
spring
to
life
in
a
spontaneous
eruption
of
sweetness
and
light
.

A
successful
low-crime
mall
in
a
high-crime
area
violates
the
more
typical
inner-city
pattern
,
in
which
commercial
areas
are
taken
over
by
unruly
youth
,
gangs
,
and
the
criminal
element
,
with
an
erosion
of
the
customer
base

The
reply
of
the
Metzenbaums

that
we
ca
n't
abolish
these
oversight

seen

The

But
the

and

But
the
rapid
changes
brought
on
by
glasnost
and
open
borders
are
altering
the
network
's
life
in
more
ways
than
one
.

Within

Mr.
Englund
added
that
next
month

data
is
n't
likely
to
be
much
better
,
because
it
will
be
distorted
by
San

's
earthquake
.

The
scandal
has
faded
and
flared
,
but
recent
disclosures
propelled
it
back
onto
the
front
pages
,
and
that
has
helped
galvanize
the
opposition
,
which
last
week
blocked
passage
of
two
constitutional
amendment
bills

For

The
results
met
estimates
of
analysts
,
who
had
already
slashed
their
projections
after
the
company
said
in
late
August
that

1989

could
tumble

Perhaps
the
ethics
of
an
industry
's
leader
filters
down
and
is
one
of
the
factors
that
ultimately
shapes
consumer
trust
in
that
industry
.

Though
Ms.

the
flashy

--
she

pretty
great

While
lower
joblessness
is
generally
good
news
,
the
hefty
drop
last
month
indicates
that
the
economy
is
n't
slowing
down
as
much
as
hoped
--
despite
a
doubling
of
interest
rates
over
the
last
16
months
.

The
most
controversial
of
these
is
stock-index
arbitrage
,
in
which
traders
buy
or
sell
baskets
of
stocks
and
offset
the
position
with
an
opposite
trade
in
stock-index
futures
to
lock
in
profits
.

Using

This
,
in
turn
,
threatens
the
massive
vested
interests
of
which
you
have
written
.

Since

There
are
some

Before

,
individuals
should

three

six
months
of
living
expenses
set
aside

you

The

So

)

The
market
closed
prior
to
Mr.
Lawson
's
announcement
.

What
few
comments
he
has
initiated
have
been
oblique
,
such
as
urging
``
greater
efforts
toward
the
protection
of
human
life
''
at
a
meeting
of
Catholic
lawyers
in
Boston
last
month

Delmed
said
Robert

resigned

It
is

of

company
,
''
said
Barry
Diller
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Fox
Inc.
unit
of
News
Corp
.

Yet
that
did
n't
eliminate
program
trading
from
the
market
.

Digital
also
said
it
has
dispatched
teams
of
technicians
to
California
.

But
,
``
You
never
can
tell
,
''
he
added
,
``
you
have
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
.

He
also
plans
to
get
to
know
clients
that
Mr.

was
closer
to
,
such
as
Lever
Brothers
,
American

and
Seagram

I
can
adjust
the
amount
of
insurance
I
want
against
the

going
into

;
I
can
pay
more
or
less
than
the
so-called
target
premium
in
a
given
year
;
and
I
can
even
skip
payments
if
my
cash
reserves
are
enough
to
cover
the
insurance
portion
of
the

Profits
are
also
plowed
back
into
the
community
;
the
non-profit
Vermont-Slauson
Economic
Development
Corp.
receives
60
%
of
the
profits
from
the
Vermont-Slauson
Center
and
uses
the
money
to
provide
moderate
and
low-cost
housing
in
the
community
--
now
running
into
the
hundreds
of
units
--
as
well
as
commercial

It
's
a
trade
secret
how
many

plastic

and
most

still
do

know
what
they
're
using
.

While
the
market
kept
careful
tabs
on
Wall
Street
's
gyrations
,
it
shrugged
off
a
modest
downturn
in
equities
to
bid
the
dollar
well
above
the
day
's
lows
.

But
the
company
said
the
amount
ca
n't
be
determined
until
it
knows
how
many
managers
opt
to
retire
.

Like
all
Americans
seeking
chronic
prosperity
,
I
do
find
it
necessary
to
plunge
certain
funds
into
conservative
monetary
tools
,
if
only
to
assuage
my
father-in-law
,
who
believes
in
such
things
.

My
response
was
that
sports
rarely
are
important
,
only
diverting
,
and
the
quake
merely
highlighted
that
fact
.

But
last

Hitachi

surprised

Hitachi
technology
to
make

But
in
the
light
of
events
in
Panama
,
where
the
U.S.
has
such
clear
strategic
interests
,
waiting
for
the
Delta
Force
may
prove
to
be
a
dangerous
gambit
.

The
opening

are
being
redone

Mr.

The
rise
came
as

continued

dump

the
sudden

According
to
one
analyst
,
Bernard
Savaiko
of
PaineWebber
,
New

,
the
stock
market
's
ability
on
Monday
to
rally
from
last
Friday
's
decline
--
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
economy
was
n't
going

fall
either
--
took
the
starch
out
of
precious
metals
prices

out

Experts
on
California
tort
law
say
protections
afforded
government
agencies
in
such
cases
are
pretty
ironclad
.

The
Ministry
of
International
Trade
and
Industry
is
so
concerned
that
it
recently
took
the
unusual
step
of
urging
Japanese
auto
companies
to
exercise
caution
in
capital
spending
.

Meanwhile
,
Shearson
Lehman
's
Mr.

said
that
,
to
stay
competitive
,
the
U.S.

needs
to
catch
up
with
the
European

.

Fending
off
attacks
on
his
economic
policies
in
a
House
of
Commons
debate
yesterday
,
Mr.
Lawson
said
inflation
``
remains
the
greatest
threat
to
our
economic
well-being
''
and
promised
to
take
``
whatever
steps
are
needed
''

choke
it
off

adds
an

to
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
.

Now
at

there
are
question
marks
about
that
,
and
without
any
question
the
pace

slowed

About

PENALTY

is
still
likely

congressional
sources

Even
some
lawyers
who
have
used

to
their
advantage
see
a
need
to
limit
their

Many
in
the
Bay
Area
's
pastry
community
express
disbelief
that
Ms.
Shere
kept
only
one
copy
of
such
valuable

,
but
she
has
received
moral
support
from
Baker

meets
regularly
to
discuss
issues
like
how
to
keep
meringues
from
weeping
and
how
bovine
eating

On
some
occasions
when
Mr.
Dinkins
has
discussed
the
issues
during
the
campaign
,
he
has
run
into
a
familiar
kind
of
trouble
.

The

prescription
drugs
.

He
said
he
believes
IBM

decision
to
invest
this
sort
of
effort
into
a

showed
that
it
was
getting
serious
about
understanding

was

just
selling

But
it
is
the
Trinity
Rep
newcomer
,
Jonathan
Fried
(

who
is
the
actor
to
watch
,
whether
he
is
hamming
it
up

conducting
the

seducing
his
neighbor

conceded
that
it
does
n't
have
data
about
applicants
to
determine
why

added

Comments
by
John
Major
,
who
has
succeeded
Mr.
Lawson
,
also
failed
to
damp
market
concern
,
despite
his
pledge
to
maintain
relatively
high
British
interest
rates
.

The
Kremlin
leader
,
on
the
first
day
of
a
three-day
official
visit
to
Helsinki
,
assured
Finland
's
president
that
the
Soviet
Union
has
``
no
moral
or
political
right
''
to
interfere
with
moves
toward
democracy
in
Poland
,
Hungary
or
elsewhere
in
Eastern
Europe
.

Amid
charges
of
``
timidity
''
on
Panama
and
elsewhere
,
the
president
was
n't
about
to
offend
his
most
energetic
constituency
.

``
If
they
think
well
of

company
through
our
support
of

it

they
'll
think
well
of
our
products
.
''

``
First
,
we
have
better
quality
assurance
than
ever
,
because
the
people
building
the
product
have
taken
on
more
responsibility
for
the
quality
of
their
own
work
.

This
is
a
fact
--
though
,
in
view
of
all
the

it

not
surprising
that
one
hears
so
little
about

Indeed
,
Morgan

Irving

a

The

``
Sometimes

,

he
says
.

But
for
the
moment
,
attention
focuses
on
the
reforms

were
put
into

,

regulators

said
the

breakers
worked
as
intended

Yet
the
heavy-handedness
of

also
can
be
effective

Goldman

,
subscribes

The

attributed
to
increased

Secondly
,
critics
have
charged

maker
Burroughs

corporate
inertia

account

of
the
patient
population

hence
a
small
part
of
the
large

lucrative
market

similar

So
far

It
is

The
longstanding
position
of
the

that

music
publishers
need
to
be
remunerated
by
government-imposed
fees

the

``

fanned
childhood
memories

only
a

Now
they
plan

However
,
Bond

said
the
tax
benefits
remain
available

might
be
used
later

Mr.

he
noted

was
weaker

he
had
anticipated

a
lower

rate

boost

Some
conservatives
will
accuse
the
president
of
promising
Congress
too
much
.

But
a
dollar
invested
in
long-term
bonds
in
1926
would
have
grown
to
only
$
16.56

and
a
dollar
put
in
Treasury
bills
would
equal
a
meager
$
9.29

No
notification
was
ever
considered

officials
said
,
apparently
because
the
U.S.

think

to
kill
Mr.
Noriega
,
but
merely
sought
to
imprison
him

``

Public
protests
against
him
were
triggered
in
June
1987
due
to
charges
by
Diaz
Herrera
,
his
former
chief
of
staff
,
that

Noriega
had
stolen
the

election

But
increased
reliance
on
nuclear
power
would
meet
stiff
opposition
from
environmentalists

a
second
ministry
official
said
.

An
NBC
spokesman
counters
that
Mr.
Holston
's
lament
was
``
entirely
consistent
''
with
NBC
plans
because
the
U.S.
rules
would
limit
NBC
's
involvement
in
the
Qintex
deal
so
severely
as
to
be
``

years

type
of

deals
available

Sony
--
and
everyone
else
except

At
first
it
attributed
the
slump
to
temporary
business
disruptions
,
but
when
no
orders
were
logged
in
August
and
September
,
manager
Donald
Lai
became
convinced
that
business
would
be
bad
for
many

have
said

Worse

the

Mr.

The

Legal

A

are
said
to
be
wary

But

a

that

The

hastened
by
foreign

But
President
Bush
is
expected
to
veto
the
congressional
legislation
and
that
,
along
with
the
easy
approval
of
the
Pennsylvania

,
is
likely
to
mute
the
abortion-rights

claims
of

underline
the

The
difference
lies
in
how
the
two

furriers
reacted
to
the
foreign
competition
and
transformation
of
their

over
the
past
10

The

But
when

that

Mr.

When

Although
some
of
the
Japanese
banks
involved
in
the
first
proposed
bid
for
UAL
bowed
out

they
found
the

unattractive
,
observers
here
say
they
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
commercial
considerations
were
the
only
reason
.

Everyone
at
the
Stick
that
day
had
started
out
as
a
spectator
and
ended
up
as
a
participant

Thomson

turns
out

Some
of
the

have
recommended
Dr.
Alan

,
54

a
former
patent
agent
with
a
doctorate
in
organic
chemistry
who
now
is
associate
general
counsel
with
SmithKline
Beckman
Corp.
in
Philadelphia
.

It
would
give
Mr.
Skinner
up
to
50
days
to
``
review
''
any
bid
for
15
%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
of
any
U.S.
carrier
with
revenues
of
$
1
billion
or
more
.

The
new
options
carry
out
part
of
an
agreement
that
the
pension
fund
,
under
pressure
to
relax
its
strict
participation
rules
and
to
provide
more
investment
options
,
reached
with
the
SEC
in
December
.

Thus
,
it
remains
crucial
for
RJR
to
obtain
top
dollar
for
its
smaller
assets
like
the
candy
brands
.

Neither

comment

It

their

Those
who

recognize
that
the

equivalent
to
an
expansionary

,
indeed
,
it
is
the
definition

Once

But
this

Democrats
argue
that
Costa

The

sent

dominated

The

attributed

At

told

that

Sen.

is
part
of
a
continuing
effort
to
shift
the
criticism
for
the
failure
of
the
recent
coup
attempt
in

They
argue
that
the
bigger
danger
would
be
that
the
West
would
delay
action
so
long
that
the
Soviets
might
back
away
from

In

paper
presented
at

annual

of
the
National

of
Business
Economists
in
San
Francisco
,
Mr.

comments
that

and
growth

very
typical
of

It
cited
cyclical
conditions
in
its
Moody

units
.

The
constraints
do
n't
bother
the
office
's
54-year-old
manager
,
Erich
Stromeyer
.

Mr.
Bush
would
be
acting
in
the
public
interest

he
let
the
Washington
elites
who
manipulate
these

--
the
bureaucrats
,
the
lobbyists
,
the
congressional
staffers
--
live
for
just
one
year
on
a
restricted
diet
.

Also
,
investors
quickly
singled
out
stocks
of
companies
expected
to
profit
or
suffer
from
the
disaster
.

The

agreed
to
defer
for

,
by
a
287-123
margin
,
the
chamber
stripped
a
Senate
initiative
to
raise
the
minimum
grant
for
smaller
states
,
such
as
New
Hampshire
and
Delaware
,
to
$
1.6

from

500,000
.

Polly
Peck
,
a
fast-growing
British
conglomerate
,
will
pay
15.6

)
for
39

new

of

But
Mr.
Pilson
has
been
put
in
the
uncomfortable
role
of
setting
off
a
bidding
frenzy
for
sports
rights
,
a
frenzy
that
the
networks
had
hoped
to
avoid
.

The
world
had
a
big
yuk
recently
when
the
Soviets
reported
a
rash
of
UFO
landings
,
one
of
them
bringing
tall
aliens
who
glowed
in
the
dark
to
Voronezh
.

Many
blue-collar
customers
of
downtown
's
no-frills
gambling
spots
have
been
lured
to
the
Strip
or
to
Laughlin
,
Nev.
,
a
Colorado
River
town
catering
to
snowbirds
and
the
recreational-vehicle
crowd
.

Many
economists
expect
the
weakness
to
continue
.

That
level
of
production
is
n't
of
much
concern
as
long
as
demand
continues
strong
,
analysts
said
.

``
It
does
n't
replace
pitching
in
the
majors
,
but
it
proves
to
me
that
I
would
have
been
able
to
play
if
I
'd
stayed
healthy

he
says
.

it

Mr.

is
whether

Bond
prices
rallied
early
yesterday
morning
as
traders
scrambled
to
buy
Treasury
issues
on
fears
that
the
Northern
California
earthquake
might
lead
to
a
stock-market
debacle
.

Under
current

,
it
is
not
financially
rational
to

And
by
late
Friday
afternoon
,
actually
after
the
close
,
we
decided
that
was
the
wrong
tone
to
take
.

Senate
Minority
Leader
Robert
Dole
(
R.
,
Kan

)
said
yesterday
on
``
Meet
the

''
:
``
I
would
hope
after
his
{
Mr.
Ortega
's
}
act
yesterday
or
the
day
before
,
we
'd
have
unanimous
support
for
quick
action
on
remaining
humanitarian
aid
.
''

He
said
it
also
agreed
to
sell
a
portion
of
its

Still
,
says
John
Sullivan

a

with

held

at
Polaroid

:
``
The

But
he
refused
,
claiming
that
he
wanted
to
see
what
happened
Monday
morning
before
making
any
public
statement
.

In
general
,
Mr.
Utsumi
said
,
Japanese

are
becoming

Later
in
the
day
,
according
to
the

,
the

reversed
itself
,
decided

Mr.

even

One
thing
is
certain
,
however
:
Mr.

,
while

,
probably
wo
n't
make
a
major

until
he
's
clear
about

added

The
failure
to

does
n't
by
itself
constitute
a
breach
.

Labeling
an

''
ca

deprive

David
Dinkins

Commodore
International
Ltd.
said
it
will
report
a
loss
for

first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
because
sales
of
personal
computers
for
the
home
market
remained
weak
in
some
major
countries
.

The
slowdown
also
results
from
chronic

raw-materials
shortages
that
force
many
factories
to
restrict
operations
to
two

three

Characteristically
,
he
did
n't
waste
much
time
getting
started

But
he
said
the

probably
wo
n't
become

major
contraction

those
of

show
what

For

the

That

essentially
what

By

shaken

I
estimate
that
these

Kind
Hearts
and
Coronets
,
''
in
which
the
entire
comedy
is
based
on
actor
Dennis
Price
's
murdering
eight
titled
relatives
(
all
played
by
Alec
Guinness
)
because
they
snubbed
his
mother
and
stand
in
the
way
of
his
acquiring
the
family
title
.

Competitors
are
known
as
the
``
enemy
.
''

But
why
should
an
iffy
$
6.79
billion
leveraged
buy-out
deal
shake
the
foundations
of
the
entire
stock
market
?

Penn
Central
Corp.
,
Cincinnati
,
said
it
agreed
in
principle
to
acquire
Noranda
Inc.
's
Carol
Cable
Co.
unit
for
$
177
million
.

The

Without
a
microscope
and
a
subpoena
,
it
's
often
hard
to
sort
out
worthwhile
causes
from
ripoffs
if
all
you
've
got
to
go
on
is
the
solicitation
itself
.

The
Conservative
government
's
decision
may
reflect
its
desire
to
shed
a
politically
sensitive
issue
well
before
the
next
election
,
expected
in
late
1991
.

For
one
thing
,
the
size
of
the
affected
market
is
enormous
--
the
European
stock
markets
account
for
some
22.5
%
of
global
stock
market
capitalization
,
with
an
estimated
value
of
$
2.175
trillion
,
according
to
Morgan
Stanley
Capital
International
.

The
letter
apparently
came
in
response
to
a
request
for
clarification
by
LIN
earlier
this
week
.

And
Bobby
Thomson
was
made
a
legend
.

Air
France
and
Lufthansa
last
month
concluded
a
far-reaching
cooperation
accord
that
includes
air-freight
activities
.

The
August
figure
reflected
a
6.4
%
rise
in
imports
and
a
0.2
%
drop
in
exports
.

``
We
think
we
're
getting
only
10
%
of
the
integration

said

Known
as

the
product
has
disappointed
investors
.

Instead
,
they
argued
that
impeachment
aims
to
protect
public
institutions
from
people
who
have
abused
their
positions
of
trust
,
irrespective
of
the
outcome
of
prior
criminal
or
civil
cases
.

The
fund
is
the
nation
's
largest
public
employee
fund
,
and
it
has
a
growing
cash
flow
now
topping
$
3
billion
a
year
.

Adding
to
Mr.
Paul
's
problems
,
dealers
(
some
with
vested
interests
)
insist
that
he
,
relying
rather
too
heavily
on
Sotheby
's
advice
,
paid
much
too
much
for
several
pieces
in
the
CenTrust

The
plan
,
proposed
by
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
Nicholas
Brady
,
calls
for
banks
either
to
make
new
loans
or
to
reduce
the
principle
on
existing
loans
or
to
cut
the
interest
rate
on
those
existing
loans
.

For

business
fell
to

ago
,
before
accounting
for

and

expense

The
lyric
chosen
--
``
long
strange
night
''
--
may
be
an
apt
footnote
to
television
spots
by
both
candidates
intended
to
portray
each
other
as
a
liar
.

The
suits
relate
to
a

200

disclosed
in

,

Options
traders
were
hurt
worse
than
others
on
Friday
because
of
the
highly
volatile
nature
of

,

often

the

The

To

What
shook
America
was
not
a
battle
for
justice

for
naked
power
,
in
which
an
army
of
judicial

rolled
over
a

Individuals
familiar
with

said
that
throughout

,
defense
attorneys
were
talking

a
trial
,
but
by
the

the

rising
on
reports

falling

But
they
have
been
at
odds
over
how
much
Mr.
Hunt
would
owe
the
government
after
his
assets
are
sold

Sales

19

to
15.7

from
13.2

in
the
corresponding
period

Steelmakers
have
also
been
adding
capacity
of
so-called
electrogalvanized
steel
,
which
is
another
way
to
make
coated
corrosion-resistant
steel
.

That
,
coupled
with
lower
semiconductor
prices
and

,
contributed

That
is
the

reported

Defense

``
The
market
was
basically
acting
on
two
contradictory
forces
,
''
said
Nauman
Barakat
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

The
uncertainty
was
multiplied
by
the
persistent
strength
of
the
dollar
,
traders
said
,
and
by
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
,
which
widened
by
31

in
August
from
the
previous
month
.

In

the

remain
bullish

point
out
that

Japan
,
several
weeks
of
aggressive

by

some

estimate
that
the

topped

Mr.

said
Georgia-Pacific
has
accounted
in
its
strategy
for
a
``
significant

in

,
an
event
that
he
said
would
temporarily
dilute
earnings
.

The
trust
is
considering
a
sale
of
its
Manville

,
but
Manville
has
the
right
of
first
refusal
on
any

Last

The

said
it
has
been
``

with
other

in
New

had
major

by
any

Many
banks
refused
to
back
the

6.79

bankers
said
it

not

he
noted
that

If

that

termed

Under

Their

However
,
Bear

A

An

Mr.

said
the

J.C.
Penney
Co.
,
which
relocated
from
New

to

Dallas
two
years

gently
wraps
itself
in
Texas
pride
through
a

:
``

Just

he

Carried
even
further
,
some

assumed
that

Mr.

But
beyond
this
decorative
nod

,
Ms.

head
off
in
a

transforms
Gorky

something
akin

And
even
those
who
say

stock-index
arbitrage
,
traders
buy
and
sell
large
amounts
of
stock
with
offsetting
trades
in
stock-index
futures
to
profit
from
fleeting
price
discrepancies
between
the
two
markets
.

By
late
yesterday
,
both
sides
appeared
prepared
to
bury
the
hatchet
.

Insurance
stocks
continued
to
climb
on
expectations
that

rise
in

``

spokeswoman
for

committee
appointed
last
May

Joseph
Lombardo
,
who
the

alleged

,
was
one
of
numerous
defendants
in
the
government
's
sweeping
racketeering
suit
against

So
,
some
see
a
special
irony
in
the
fact
that
Mr.
Steinhardt
,
the
trader
,
now
is
encumbered
with
a
massive
,
illiquid
airline
holding

He
also
expects

it

To

In

,
Mr.

said
,
the
worm
sends
strange
messages
to
other
machines
at
the
center
--
such
as
,

George

``

The

Lawsuits

At

,
the

may
hear
only
about

the

complaints
are
resolved
at

In
Panama
,
the
U.S.
interests
at
stake
were
happily
minor
;
the
only
people
killed
were
foreigners
hapless
enough
to
trust
American
will
.

Above
all
,
though
,
proponents
say
neither
the
Contra
nor
the
SDI
cause
can
be
pushed
much
further
without
more
presidential
support
.

So
what
does
George
Bush
really
believe
?

She
was
devoted
to
Charles
de
Gaulle
's
cause
,
accepting
great
financial
sacrifice
and
considerable
risk
to
become
first
a
spy
and
then
a
one-woman
USO
tour
for
the
forces
of
Free
France

Mr.

also
conveyed
intelligence
from

Of

I
'd
rather
have

The
greatest
contribution
Congress
could
make
at
this
time
would
be
to
declare
that
stabilizing
the
price
level
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
Federal

System
.

Mr.
Maynard
's
forces
finally
defeated
the
measure
,
though
it
took
a
vote
on
the
floor
of
the
House

Representatives
to
do
it
.

Analysts
were
only
slightly
disappointed
by

Will
the
adoption
of
this
particular
form
of
a

significantly
improve
the
chances
for

to
carry
out
this

?

at
Sears

Many
economists
have
started
predicting
a
mild

next

For
the
nine
months
,
the

trimmed

Despite

one
of
a
series

In
Washington
,
the
Bush
administration
took
a
characteristically
cautious
and
skeptical
view
of
the
leadership
change
.

The
company
reported
a
big
third-quarter
loss
on
Thursday
.

Santa
Clara
County
has
a
running
total
so
far
of
$
504
million
,
excluding
the
hard-hit
city
of
Los
Gatos
.

Next
to
them
was
the
red
flag
of
the
outlawed
South
African
Communist
Party
,
which
has
long
been
an
ANC
ally
.

Texas
is
big

they
live
here

that
's
all
.

Cupboard
doors
were
flying
,
the
trash
can
in
the
kitchen
walked
a
few
feet
,
the
dogs
came
running
,
and
I
scooted
them
into
the
dog
run
and
stood
in
the
doorway
myself
,
watching
the
outside
trash
cans
dance
across
the
concrete
.

It
is
generally
agreed
that
when
CFCs
rise
from
earth
to
stratosphere
,
the
chlorine
in
them
is
capable
of
interfering
with
the
process
through
which
ultraviolet
rays
split
oxygen
molecules
and
form
ozone
.

Railroad-rate
increases
are
likely
to
be
restrained
by
weakening
rail-traffic
levels
and
keen
competition
for
freight
from
trucks
.

The
experts
said
they
expected
Eastern
would
have
to
issue
new
debt
to
cover
its
costs
,
and
that
it
would
generate
far
less
cash
than
anticipated
.

The
stock
market
is
certainly
not
too
big
for
the
Fed
to
handle
.

As
the
hearings
begin
,
the
self-important
Sen.
Bowman

thing
at

During

significant

The
complex

,
known
in
the

as

,
has
been
hotly
contested
by
all
sides
,
including

,
pipelines
,
local
distribution
companies
and
consumers

That

by

late
Monday
that
the

In
deciding
whether
forfeiture
(
and
,
hence
,
a
TRO
)
is
appropriate
,
the
Section
will
consider
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
offense
;
the
government
's
policy
is
not
to
seek
the
fullest
forfeiture
permissible
under
the
law
where
that
forfeiture
would
be
disproportionate
to
the
defendant
's
crime
.

But

if

then
it
may
become
much
more
important
.

The
trial
of
Raful
Edmond
III
in
Washington
serves
to
highlight
our
efforts
in
this
area
and
the
results
achieved
through
our
excellent
working
relationship
with
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
and
the
Metropolitan
Police
Department
(

.

Some
traders
estimate
$
9.75
billion
of
new
two-year
Treasurys
will
be
sold
next

,
and
they
expect
Refcorp
to
offer
$
4
billion
to
$
6
billion
of
long-term
``
bailout
''
bonds
.

And
in
most
cases
,
a
huge
hunk
of
your
premium
in
the
initial
year
or
two
of
the
the
policy
is
,
in
effect
,
paying
the
salesman
's
commission
as
well
;
investment
returns
on
most
policies
are
actually
negative
for
several
years
,
largely
because
of
this
.

Telelawyer
is
apparently
the
only
telephone
service
that
offers
the
telephone
equivalent
of
an
office
visit
.

In
the
fibers
division
,
profit
remains
weak
,
largely
because
of
persistent
overcapacity
.

The
ceiling
would
be
lifted
to
21.5
million
barrels
to
provide
Kuwait

the
United

much
higher
official
quotas
while
reducing
percentage
shares
of
some
others
.

Great
American
said
it
increased
its
loan-loss
reserves
by
$
93
million
after
reviewing
its
loan
portfolio
,
raising
its
total
loan
and
real
estate
reserves
to
$
217
million
.

Thus
,
a
court
is
poorly
positioned
to
make
judgments
about
the
social
utility
of
the
expanded
rule
.

Conservative
appearances
make
people
think
it
's
a
conservative
investment
.

In
fact
,
during
last
year
's
campaign
,
the
entire
nation
constantly
heard
Mr.
Bush
tout
his
accomplishments
as
head
of
the
Task
Force
on
Regulatory
Relief
.

For
small
companies
,
he
says
,
interest
rates
are
far
more
important
than
what
happens
on
stock
exchanges

``
We
proved
a
healthy
office

n't
cost

,
''
says
Frederic
Krupp
,
executive
director
of
the

.

Much
of
the
money
was
fraudulently
concealed
through
purchases
of
prime
Manhattan
real
estate
,
federal
prosecutors
have
charged
.

Concern
about
declines
in
other
markets
,
especially
New
York
,
caused
selling
pressure
.

Through
these
investigations
we
do
not
focus
on
the
street
drug
user
,
but
rather
we
target
and
attack
major
drug-trafficking
organizations
that
control
a
large
segment
of
the
drug
market
.

Harold
Jones
,
Lincoln
's
chief
retail
banking
officer
,
said
there
has
n't
yet
been
``
a

the
ad
included
a
coupon
that
could
arrive
later

Corporate
pride
as
well
as
the
close
ties
common
among
Japanese
manufacturers
help
explain
why
.

Three
A.D.L.
inventors
applied
April
6
,
1973
,
for
the
patent
,
which
was
assigned
and
awarded
in
1976
to
Hasbro
Industries
,

Eagle

parent
.

Only
time
will
tell
if
Mr.
Boyd

restore
to
the

the
acclaim
it
received
when
its

,
Nina
Vance
,
was
at
the
height
of
her
powers
.

Barring
any
petroleum-related
news
events
,
trading
in
the
days
ahead
should
further
test
recent
projections
by
oil
economists
and
other
market
watchers
that
strong
fourth-quarter
demand
will
keep
prices
firm
.

By
comparison
,
Republicans
have
held
closer
to
the
anti-abortion
movement
.

The

was
created
by
the
Trans-Alaska
Pipeline
Act
,
which
provides
that
the

spill

pay

14

Mr.
Johnson
said
the
first-quarter
loss
also
heavily
reflected
a
rapid
change
in
graphics
technology

left

Yesterday

in

five-year
contract

make

exclusively
for

,
citing
Securities

Commission
filings
made
by

that
described
the

.

Life
is

nerve-racking

companies
that
had
planned
to
go
public
this

In
his
affidavit
filed

Warner
's
Mr.

indicated
he
is
n't
buying
any
such
argument
:
``
If

little
access

an

training

better

In
addition
,
the
company
said
ongoing
cost-cutting
efforts
contributed
to
the

upturn

This
picture
is
about

will
last

waiting
to
cement
it
until
just
before
the
old
man
dies
.

If
there
is
no
moral
prohibition
that
expressly
forbids
it
,
full
speed
ahead

That
puts

broker
at
risk

buy
stock
in

Other

note
that
UAL

having
accepted

,
might
hold
out
for
a

closer

Mr.

In

Michael

But

But

the

The
move
is
the
biggest

A

of

increase

only
a
modest
increase
in

,
sugar

likely
to
rise
above
the
top

range
without
a
crop
problem

Here

The

Trucking

The

As
a

,
Microsoft

of
sales
,
fell
17
%
from
the
year-ago
quarter
and
13
%
from
the
previous
period
.

That
would
give
agencies
``
less
ability

to
fudge
over
things
,
''
he
told
reporters
.

However
,
when
powerful
forces
start
shaking
the

,
the
more
``
earthquake-resistant
''
it
is
,
the
better
its
chance
for
survival
.

The

chastises
the

Thursday

Says

,
``
Every

diminish

This

And
laws

to
generate
form-letter
inquiries
to

.

``

It

The

notes
that

What
far
too
many

I
am
not

did

some
of

Indians

The

An

such

In

came
lots
of

When
he
arrived

the
start
of
an
eight-year
tour
--
he
tried
selling
Japanese
yen-denominated
bonds
to

.

He
gave
10-to-1
odds
that

though
it
probably

Mr.

Labor
costs
,
which
leveled
off

past
few
years
because
of
lower

for

are
on
the
upswing
again
at

.

A
few

at

two

Those

largely
as

For

says
the

lost

including
its

The
statement

,
McCaw

The

building
three
cruise
ships
for
the
company
,
is
having
financial
trouble
and
may
already
have
filed
for

The
statement
is
likely
to
sharpen

Time
Warner
Inc.
and
Sony

may
be
today

public
enemies
,
but
the
two
entertainment
giants
could
end
up
becoming
partners
in
a
number
of
ventures
as
part
of
a
settlement
of
their
acrimonious
legal
dispute
over
Hollywood
producers
Peter
Guber
and
Jon
Peters
.

It
unfortunately
encourages
others
to
engage
in
a
highly
dangerous
and
illegal
activity
that
only
a
very
few

The

Unable

The

The

There
,
Mr.
Shevardnadze
felt
legitimized
to
unveil
his
own
peace
plan
:
The
U.S.S.R.
would
prolong
a
suspension
of
arms
shipments
to
Nicaragua
after
the
February
election
if
the
U.S.
did
likewise
with
its
allies
in
Central
America
.

He
said
he
set
up
shop

sidewalk
in

his
town-house
office

helped

federal
aid
--
free

Under
a
post-1987

reform
,
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
would
n't
permit
the
December
S&P
futures
to
fall
further
than
12
points
for
a
half
hour
.

In
other
words
,
Congress
wo
n't
let
the
CIA
do
much
of
anything
anymore
,
and
that
's
fine
with
the
CIA

``
That

something

A

an
open

for
what
Colombian

and
exports
should
be
the
policy
of
the
U.S.

Such
a
change
meant
the
reorganization
plan
the
creditors
had
agreed
on
was
no
longer
valid
,
and
the
two
sides
had
to
begin
negotiating
again
.

Mr.

And
,
with
no
other
offers
on
the
table
,
the
board
apparently
felt
no
pressure
to
act
on
it
.

She

The

On

Beijing

have
taught
many

that

said
the

gripes

And
when

rivals
catch
up
,

headaches

be
on
the
alert
for
similar
buying
opportunities
now
,
they
're
afraid
of
being
hammered
by
another
terrifying
plunge
.

Wall
Street
analysts
expect
the
disappointing
trend
to
continue
into
the
fourth
quarter
and
through
at
least
the
first
two
quarters
of
1990
,
when
the
industry
will
increasingly
see
the
effect
of
price
erosion
in
major
product
lines
,
such
as
rolled
sheet
used
for
cars
,
appliances
and
construction
.

It
was
n't
until
the
early
1980s
that
Akzo
nursed
itself
back
to
health
.

The
charge
resulted
from
a
settlement
approved
yesterday
by
the
Massachusetts
Department
of
Public
Utilities
.

The
company
has
no
immediate
plans
to
close
any
operations
,
she
said
,
but
Quotron
may
subcontract
some
work
that
it
has
been
doing
in-house
,
including
refurbishment
and
production
of
Quotron
1000
equipment
used
in
delivering
financial
data
.

In
addition
,
perhaps
5
%
of
registrants
will
come
from
a
new
category
consisting
of
applicants
whose
academic
credentials
``
narrowly
missed
''
gaining
them
admission
in
the
first
category
.

``
Every
moment
we
want
to
know
everything
about
the
world
.

At
Movieline
,
she
wants
``
specific
paragraphing
,
specific
tone
,
a
specific
attitude
--
bright
and
bold
and
tongue-in-cheek
.

The
laptops
are
not
revolutionary
and
,
indeed
,
are
tardy
in
a
market
first
opened
by
GRiD
Systems
Corp.
,
now
a
unit
of
Tandy
Corp.
,
almost
two
years
ago
.

The
Packwood
proposal
would
reduce
the
tax
depending
on
how
long
an
asset
was
held
.

Inco
said
it
plans
to
buy
back
as
many
as
five
million
common
shares
over
the
next
12
months
if
nickel
market
conditions
are
favorable
.

But
on
the
bearish
side
,
that
may
be
too
much
to
expect
.

The
Turkish
refugee
tragedy
and
the
ongoing
crisis
can
not
be
ignored
and
shuttled
off
to
that
notorious
dustbin
of
history
that
has
become
so
convenient
recently
.

Private
industry
's
labor
costs
rose
1.2
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
matching
the
second-quarter
pace
,
as
health
insurance
costs
continued
to
soar
,
the
Labor
Department
said
.

The
situation
was
further
aggravated
early
this
month
,
when
McDonald
's
set
plans
to
heat
up
the
discounting
by
offering
coupons
.

On
Monday
,
for
instance
,
Howard
Ward
,
a
principal
at
Scudder
,
Stevens
&
Clark
,
found
that
``
you
could
n't
buy
blue-chips
at
quoted
prices
without
paying
up
.
''

Ford
managed
to
show
a
profit
for
the
quarter
primarily
because
of
earnings
from
overseas
auto
operations
and
financial
services
.

Campeau
's
chairman
,
Robert
Campeau
,
said
at
its
annual
meeting
in
July
that
he
valued
Bloomingdale
's
at
$
2
billion
.

Operating
profit
from
electrical
and
electronics
controls
,
Eaton
's
other
major
business
group
,
fell
11
%
to
$
32
million
,
despite
a
7.7
%
increase
in
sales
to
$
376
million
.

It
's
the
line-item
veto
,
a
procedure
that
would
allow
the
president
to
kill
individual
items
in
a
big
spending
bill
passed
by
Congress
without
vetoing
the
entire
bill
.

But
a
partial
recovery
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
,
which
had
been
down
more
than
60
points
in
midmorning
,
dashed
those
expectations
.

GMAC
profits
are
combined
with
earnings
from
the
rest
of
GM
's
operations
and
attributed
to
the
company
's
traditional
common
stock
.

That
means
making
sure
that
copies
of
vital
computer
software
and
company
records
are
out
of
harm
's
way
.

And
profit
from
polymers
dropped
to
$
107
million
from
$
122
million
amid
what
Du
Pont
called
lower
demand
and
selling
prices
in
certain
packaging
and
industrial
markets
.

So
often
are
government
statistics
revised
that
they
seem
to
resemble
a
spinning
weather
vane
.

But
they
are
already
objecting
to
,
among
other
things
,
a
plan
to
give
more
weight
to
cost-benefit
considerations
in
evaluating
pesticides
.

--
Give
the
EPA
added
discretion
to
set
``
negligible
risk
''
levels
for
pesticide
residues
in
processed
food
.

That
should
help
to
inspire
confidence
,
Mr.
Gilmore
says
.

Mr.
Bergsma
said
Akzo
is
likely
to
see
strong
profit
growth
from
coatings
as
it
realizes
cost
savings
and
other
benefits
from
its
greater
scale
.

Some
gripes
about
red
tape
are
predictable
:
Architects
complain
about
a
host
of
building
regulations
,
auto
leasing
companies
about
car
insurance
rules
.

Dick
Pound
,
a
committee
member
,
began
by
disclosing
that
ABC
and
NBC
had
refused
to
even
bid
.

Boeing
Co.
,
already
struck
by
its
Machinists
union
,
briefly
called
off
contract
talks
with
its
engineers
and
labeled
their
demands
``
grossly
excessive
.
''

It
ripens
later
than
most
apples
,
and
growing
it
in
U.S.
areas
with
chilly
autumns
may
be
tricky
.

Mr.
Percival
declined
to
comment
.

Also
,
it
has
not
yet
been
decided
exactly
how
much
of
the
mortgage
AEW
will
be
able
to
convert
into
equity
.

Federal
and
state
thrift
examiners
said
they
saw
evidence
of
criminal
wrongdoing
in
the
collapse
of
Lincoln
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
and
a
California
regulator
described
an
attempted
``

by

of

Wall
.

,
will
take

this
British

.

Mr.

,
the

got
the

bug
and
formed
Litigation
Sciences
.

The
judge
,
suspended
from
his
bench
pending
his
trial
,
which
began
this
week
,
vehemently
denies
all
the
allegations
against
him
,
calling
them
``
ludicrous
''
and
``
imaginative
,
political
demagoguery
.
''

Mr.
Laff
's
attorney
,
John
Lang
,
filed
a
memorandum
asking
that
the
trial
record
include
a
secretly
taped
conversation
in
which
the
witness
,
Henry
Lorin
,
told
a
Haas
stockbroker
that
Mr.
Laff
should
be
killed
.

Further
,
he
said
,
an
internal
reorganization
to
combine
several
divisions
into
the
Information
Technology
Group
is
expected
to
affect
fourth-quarter
results
by
an
undisclosed
amount
.

For
the
past
week
or
so
,
traders
have
been
expecting
India
to
buy
between
150,000
and
200,000
tons
of
refined
sugar
,
and
there
have
been
expectations
of
a
major
purchase
by
Japan
.

The
benchmark
30-year
bond
ended
at
a
price
of
100
29\/32
to

compared
with
100

One
senior
vice

at
Bechtel
said
he
got

``
The
number

was
45
%

school
absences
did
n't
change
much
,
''
said
Mr.
Bruner
.

The
vast
majority
of
them
,
however
,
were
wiped
out
by
a
succession
of
environmental
upheavals
that
were
too
sudden
and
catastrophic
for
the
normal
rules
of
natural
selection
to
operate
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
is
expected
to
launch
its

trading

today

just
as
controversy
over
this
trading
strategy
heats
up
.

Yields
for

Investors
who
wish
to
be
out
of
a
position
,
without
the
risk
of
receiving
a
worse-than-expected
price
from
a
market
order
,
may
use
this
type
of
order
to
specify
the
price
at
which
the
order
must
be
filled
.

He
said
there
is
``
no
valid
investment
reason
''
for
stock-index
futures
to
exist
.

Some
,
however
,
lowered
yields
significantly
.

Only
one
thing
is
certain
here
:
Pysllium
is
likely
to
remain
solely
an
export
item
from
Sidhpur
for
a
long
time
.

U.S.
exports
benefited
in
August
from
heavy
Canadian
spending
on
new
plant
and
equipment
and
a
pickup
in
Canadian
auto
demand
,
Canadian
officials
said
.

But
though
couriers
work
as
many
as
60
hours
a
week
during
the
autumn
rush
,
they
leave
early
during
slack
times
while
still
being
assured
of
a
minimum
paycheck
.

One
senior
executive
at
his
firm
spends
nearly
20
%
of
his
time
on
insurance
,
he
says
.

Automotive
sales
jumped
16
%
to
$
791
million
,
mainly
because
of
higher
sales
of
air
bags
and
other
passenger
restraint
systems
,
TRW
said
.

FRINGE-BENEFIT
spending
by
small

medium-sized

What
to
do
?

Royal
withdrew
its

to
buy
Realist
,
a
maker
of
optical
and
electronic
products

in
Menomonee
Falls

Wis.
,
for

14.06

after
Realist
disclosed
the
Ammann
purchase
.

Traders
and
analysts
said
they
did
n't
see
any
effect
on
Tokyo
stocks
from
the
California
earthquake
.

Fueling
the
growth
,
among
other
things
,
were
higher-than-expected
prices
for
certain

.

The
Red
Cross
has
opened
30

And
indeed

as
he
later
reported
,
that
was
the
import
of
the
meeting
.

If
Mr.

has
a
weakness

Whatever
the
outcome
of
a
test
case
,
President
Bush
would
have
to
move
cautiously
becase
the
very
attempt
would
``

William

,
said
plans
to
consider
a
sale
of
the
company
or
some
of
its

``
on
track

for
what
has
been
described

and
deliberate

Insurers
struggled

to
get
a
firm
grasp

``
You
can
find
some

''
but
investors
should
be
selective

John

Newark
,
N.J.

money
management
company
with
about

900

of
varying
sizes

'm
certainly

Merieux
officials
said
last
week
that
they
are
``
highly
confident
''
the
offer
will
be
approved
once
it
submits
details
of
its
proposed
investments
to
federal
regulators
.

But
it
continued
to
badly
trail
its
San
Francisco
neighbor
,
Wells
Fargo
&
Co.
,
which
reported
an
extraordinary
1.25
%
return
on
assets
.

At
the
last
minute
,
however
,
Pakistani
officials
sent
in
Gulbuddin
Hekhmatyar
,
perhaps
the
most
hated
and
feared
of
the
extremists
,
with
a
demand
that
the
surrender
be
made
to
his
forces
.

When
the
company
this
month
announced
lower-than-forecast
sales
of
Easy
Eggs
,
the
stock
dropped
nearly
19
%
.

He
said
Westmoreland
is
looking
at
investment
stakes
in
other
cogeneration
plants
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
.

Less
objectionable
ones
would
be
subject
only
to
some
restraints
,
and
others
with
a
``
relatively
minor
trade
impact
''
would
be
allowed
to
continue
under
certain
conditions
.

The
coupon
will
be
reset
in
one
year
at
a
rate
that
will
give

a
market
value
of
101
.

One
senior
administration
official
called
the
guideline
``
outrageous
''
and
said
it
could
make
U.S.
operatives
reluctant
to
even
listen
to
coup
plans
for
fear
they
may
get
into
legal
trouble

nothing

Mr.
Guber
says
.

Perhaps
Mr.
Greve
was
confused
by
Congress
's
meaningless
statement
of
``
the
national
goal
''
in
section
101
,
which
indeed
calls
for
the
elimination
of

by

1\/4

in

added
that

cut
off

to
some
rebel
units

it
was
determined
that

And
while
last
week
the

to
try
to
bolster
its

These
problems
also
resulted
in

Another

As

Another

Ronald

side

reason
:

As

a

119.88

,
or
4.7

.

It
also
prevents
the
conduct
of
a
policy
that
has
a
long-term
rationale
,
because
it
leaves
the
Fed
guessing
about
what
are
the
expectations
of
its

,
the

,
who
have
never
had

The

they

,
which
retail
for
$
5
to

``
Insitutional
investors

,
Mr.

strongly
drawn

But
the

of

At

Frederick

delivered
a
sobering
message
about
the
junk
bond
market
to
officials
of
Prudential
Insurance
Co.
of
America
.

At
one
point
,
he
asked
a
worker
whether
he
thought
East
Germans
were
fleeing
the
country
because
of
restrictive
travel
policies
.

Birmingham
Steel
Corp.
said
that
its
Emeryville
,
Calif.
,
minimill
sustained
only
minor
damage
from
last
week
's
earthquake
.

And
the
reason
we
do
n't
want
to
is
that
effective
education
would
require
us
to
relinquish
some
cherished
metaphysical
beliefs
about
human
nature
in
general
and
the
human
nature
of
young
people
in
particular
,
as
well
as
to
violate
some
cherished
vested
interests
.

The
agency
noted
,
however
,
the
estimate
will
likely
be
confirmed
.

Having
seen
the
hypocrisy
with
which
Congress
has
addressed

HUD
scandals
,
we
disagree

the

The

stopped

gave
up

Yet

has
proved
more
resilient
than

a

said
.

You
are
absolutely
wrong
,
however
,
in
opining
that
this
position
is
some
kind
of
``
flip-flop
,
''
something
newly
arrived
at
as
a
result
of
reading
the
opinion
polls
.

State

Still
,
the

because
of

During

buy

it
tipped

However
,
as
is
common
with

the

market
's
recent
troubles
and
as
the

weakens
,
the
dollar
ended
down
only
modestly
.

Dow
blamed
the
third-quarter
earnings
drop
on
several
factors
,
including
softer
prices
for
polyethylene
and
other
basic
chemicals
,
a
slower
U.S.

a
stronger

in

It

been
wary

The

drop
a

pushing
them
up

However

shuttering

Behind

a

``

it

Mr.

do

have
much
to

from
a
protracted

.

But
it
initially
was
funded
with
about
$
765

soon
face
a

he
wo

out

burst
out

quarter
,
is
n't
expected
to
exceed
$
50
million
after
taxes
,
the
company
added
.

In
addition
,
power
failures
prevented
its
package-sorting
facilities
from
operating
,
causing
delays
.

It
was
fear
of
disturbing
EMS
exchange-rate
relationships
that
caused
the
Chirac
government
in
France
to
be
timid
about
cutting
tax
rates
.

The
talks
came
as
Lebanese
negotiations
on
political
changes
appeared
deadlocked
.

Revenue
for
the
nine
months
is
expected
to
be
about
$
230.5
million
,
up
about
21
%
from
$
190.4
million
last
year
.

The
two
developments
leave
the
airline
with
several
problems
,
including
an
unsettled
labor
situation
.

Despite
warnings
from
such
leaders
as
former
Federal
Reserve
Board
Chairman
William
McChesney
Martin
that
unfixed
commissions
would
undo
the
industry
,
the
SEC
in
September
1973
said
full
competition
must
start
May
l
,
1975
.

This
means
``
tracking
,
''
whose
main
purpose
is
less
to
permit
the
gifted
youngsters
to
flourish
(
though
that
is
clearly
desirable
)
than
to
ensure
that
the
less
gifted
get
the
necessary
grounding
for
further
study
or
for
entering
the
modern
world
of
work
.

Civilized
discourse
and
an
environment
where
compromise
can
begin
are
lost
in
a
hostile
posture
abetted
by
superficial
media
interviews
.

Most
other
bonds
,
however
,
would
probably
not
have
fared
much
better
.

Great
Northern
Nekoosa
said
,
``
The
odds
of
the

predictions
about

being

(
Keeping
cool
is
a
Dinkins
priority
:
On
humid
days
this
summer
,
he
was
known
to
change
his
double-breasted
suits
as
many
as
four
times
a
day
.
)

Earlier
this
year
,
the
company
sold
a
similar
unit
in
Europe
for
about
$
25
million
.

The
bonds
are
rated
single-A-1
by
Moody
's
and
double-A-minus
by
S&P
.

The
acquisition
would
give
Wilmington
,
Del.-based
Star
States
access
to
the
Pennsylvania
market
.

In
fact
,
sophisticated
big-bucks
boiler-room
scams
are
known
generically
among
law-enforcement
types
as
``
Newport
Beach
''
operations
.

The
blue-collar
machinists
,
longtime
rivals
of
the
white-collar
pilots
,
say
the
buyout
would
load
the
company
with
debt
and
weaken
its
finances
.

Bond
prices
posted
strong
gains
as
investors
went
on
a
bargain
hunt
.

``
We
're
planning
on
a
rip-roaring
year
in
1989
,
but
next
year
we
'll
be
another
story
,
''
said
Robert
Freedman
,
a
partner
at
Simpson
Thacher
&
Bartlett
.

The
company
did
n't
disclose
the
new
estimate
but
said
the
change
was
related
to
Integrated
's
failure
to
sell
its
core
businesses
,
as
well
as
``
other
events
,
''
which
it
did
n't
detail
,
that
occurred
after
its
announcement
last
week
that
it
was
in
talks
with
the
unidentified
prospective
buyer
.

Certainly
,
the
Oct.
13
sell-off
did
n't
settle
any
stomachs
.

However
,
unlike
Messrs.
Graedel
and
Crutzen
,
who
are
both
pioneers
in
the
study
of
atmospheric
chemistry
,
Mr.
Teagan
has
no
special
expertise
in
the
area
.

Four
of
those
insiders
sold
more
than
half
their
holdings
.

The
big
questions
are
whether
the
increase
,
effective
Jan.
1
,
1990
,
will
stick
,
and
whether
other
major
steelmakers
will
follow
suit
.

Taking
into
account
nonrecurring
gains
and
losses
,
Hachette
's
group
net
income
for
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
totaled
246.6
million
francs
,
practically
double
the
year-earlier
figure
of
124.5
million
francs
.

The
company
said
it
is
n't
making
a
commitment
to
purchase
a
specific
number
of
shares
.

Unfortunately
,
Mr.
Bork
failed
to
distinguish
between
such
pressures
and
the
emergence
of
great
issues
critical
to
a
society
that
must
be
settled
judicially
if
it
is
to
cohere
.

When
a
regional
economy
catches
cold
,
the
local
real-estate
market
gets
pneumonia
.

Among
steel
shares
,
NKK
rose
19
to
705
yen
(
$
4.97
)
a
share
,
and
Nippon
Steel
gained
17
to
735
.

Later
,
Mr.
Brady
phoned
Mr.
Greenspan
,
SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
and
numerous
contacts
in
New
York
and
overseas
.

Yet
at
the
moment
they
are
the
judges
who
are
making
the
law
.

Darkness
fell
.

In
its
bankruptcy-law
petition
,
filed
in
U.S.
Bankruptcy
Court
in
Manhattan
,
Eagle
said
its
problems
began
in
1987
and
early
1988
when
its
then-senior
lender
,
Bankers
Trust
Co.
,
reduced
its
credit
line
.

She
will
oversee
Working
Woman
,
Working
Mother
and
Success
magazines
,
and
retain
her
post
as
publisher
of
Working
Woman
.

No
reason
was
given
in
the
filing
for
the
sales
.

Mr.
Achenbaum
,
too
,
delves
into
his
clients
'
business
.

However
,
relying
on
an
ardent
critic
of
the
Reagan
administration
and
the
Contra
movement
for
help
in
delaying
the
disarming
of
the
Contras
was
risky
business
.

C.
Hyde
Tucker
will
become

chief
executive
officer
of
Bell
Atlantic

,
a
unit

telecommunications
concern
,
effective
Jan.
1
.

But
the
computer
did
n't
play
Mr.
Short
's
ninth
move
,
a
key
pawn
thrust
,
and
its
position
deteriorated
rapidly
.

However
,
he
said
he
planned
to
spend
the
weekend
making
calls
to
gather
additional
support
.

Jens-Uwe
Fischer
,
a
senior
trader
at
Manufacturers
Hanover
Trust

as

data

trade
figures

off

``
There
are
about
a

more
deals
coming

said
Michael
McNamara
,
director
of
fixed-income
research
at
Kemper

Services
Inc
.

They
are

capitalized

Douglas
H.
Miller
,
self-employed
in
the
oil
and
gas
securities
business
,
was
named
chairman
of
this
oil
and
gas
exploration
company
,
filling
a
vacancy
.

Another
finding
from
the
study
:
Prosecutors
set
significantly
different
priorities
.

``
They
are
growing
more
pragmatic
about
their
role
.
''

Although
the
plant
itself
was
n't
damaged
,
Mr.
Johnson
said
millions
of
dollars
in
first-quarter
revenue
were
lost
.

Traders
are
already
buckling
their
seat
belts
.

The
fund
,
with
a
cash
cushion
of
more
than
10
%
,
has
``
met
all
the
redemptions
without
having
to
sell
one
thing
,
''
Mr.
Litvack
says
.

``
It
is
clear
,
''
Ms.
Waite
says
,
``
that
most
of
the
effect
of
increasing

has
been

Today

As

of
the
move
,
its
affiliated
U.S.

,
International

Technology

,
purchased
a
Mexican

Erich
Krampe
,
president
of
the

arm

auto

,
predicted
luxury-car
sales
will
rise
to
840,000
in
1990
from
830,000
this
year
primarily
because
of
the
new
Japanese
makes
.

The
sale
price
of
the
unit
,
which
makes
packaging
products
,
was
to
consist
of
cash
,
notes
and
an
amount
to
be
determined
by
the
unit
's
future
performance
.

You

see
carriers
try
to
recoup
some
of
the

Indeed
,
the
government
is
taking
a
calculated
risk
.

SsangYong
,
which
has
only
about
3
%
of
the
domestic
market
,
will
sell
about
18,000
of
its
models
this
year
,
twice
as
many
as
last
year
.

It
expects
to
post
a
loss
of
6.4
billion
yen
for
the
year
ending
tomorrow
and
its
liabilities
currently
exceed
its
assets
by
about
13.8
billion

Our
advice
is
this
:
Immediately
return
the

to
the

through
incentive-maximizing
tax
cuts

find
some
monetary
policy
target
that
balances

demand

Most

Mr.

a
bear
market
in

and
a

the
advice

Traders
said
that
statements
made
over

weekend
to
quell
concern
about
the
stability
of
Prime
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
's
government
and
the
future
of
her
economic
program
largely
failed
to
reassure
investors
and
bolster
the
flagging
British
unit
.

Making
matters
worse
was
the
fact
that
late
Friday
afternoon
the
CBOE
halted
stock-index
options
trading
in
step
with
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
's
halt
in
stock-index
futures
.

The
U.S.
,
as
the
major
drug
consumer
,
should
lead
this
joint
effort
.

The
biggest
drop
was
recorded
by
primary

producers
,
a
category
that
includes
the
steel
industry
.

But
as
soon
as
the
accords
were
signed
,
American
officials
sharply
reduced
aid
.

That
proposal
,
valued
at
between
$
225
and
$
240
a
share
,
would
have
transferred
majority
ownership
to
employees
while
leaving
some
stock
in
public
hands

GE
's
Kidder
Peabody
unit
said
it
would
stop
doing

arbitrage
for
its

,
while
Merrill

said
it
was
halting
such
trading
entirely
.

It
is
possible
that
,
in
perpetuating
such
myths
,
the
ground
is
being
laid
for
the
arrest
of
opposition
activists
on
the
ground
of
terrorism

His
success
is
easy

It
all
seemed
innocent
enough
:
Last

A
U.S.

a
wave
of
merger
activity

In

The
reconciliation
talks
in
the
Libyan
desert

Tobruk
followed
a

.

It
was
the
possibility
of
this
demand
that
helped
firm

,
the

said
.

The
mineral
concern
's
own
reorganization
plan
met
a
similar
fate
after
opposition
from
the
IRS
and
Manufacturers
Hanover
.

But
one
Bush
administration
official
knowledgeable
about
the
summit
plan
cautioned
against
assuming
that
there
will
be
bold
new
initiatives
on
the
Soviet
economy
or
other
issues
.

A

Researchers
at
Sandia
National

Albuquerque

reported
they
went

far

to
take
a

cold
fusion
''
experiment
and
three
neutron
detectors
into
a
tunnel
under
300
feet
of
granite
to
shield
the

But
for
individuals
who
buy
much
smaller
amounts
and
care
less
about
relative
performance
than
in
preserving
what
they
have
,
that
margin
is
meaningless
.

For
now
,
says
Laurence
Drivon
,
president-elect
of
the
6,000-member
California
Trial
Lawyers
Association
,
``
the
last
thing
we
really

whether

is
going

whether

at

The

proved

The
surge
in
producer
prices
in
September
followed
three
months
of
declines
,
but
analysts
were
divided
on
whether
the
0.9
%
jump
signaled
a
severe
worsening
of
inflation
.

rallied
on
good

reports

on

that
showed
less
inflation

expected
.

Food

The

But
Mr.
Phillips
recently
freed
himself
up
to
spend
more
time
with
clients
by
delegating
much
of
his
administrative
work
to
a
deputy
.

Those
portfolios
are
remarkably
diversified
.

Mr.
Rambo
says
that
a
3.2-acre
property
overlooking

Valley
is
priced
at
$
4
million
because
the
late
actor
Erroll
Flynn
once
lived
there
.

Texaco
has
also
been
attempting
to
sell
oil
properties

Mr.

says
he
passed
that
along
to
his
adversary

and
soon
they
were
talking
about
the
ground
rules
under
which
Derr
could
keep
its
money
and
the
plaintiffs
could
take
a
shot
at
Mr.
Alexander
.

But
two
big
New
York
banks
seem
to
have
kicked
those
chances
away
,
for
the
moment
,
with
the
embarrassing
failure
of
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.

deliver
$
7.2

financing

Mr.

's
departure
,
while
sudden
,
was
seen
as
inevitable
in
light
of
the
shift
in
strategy
.

But
it
was
clear
that
for
the
time
being
,
the
board
wants
the
company
to
return
to
normalcy

The

,
who
begs
anonymity

asserts
that
the

Mr.

,
says
he
and
Mr.
Daly
instructed
Mr.
Semel
to
tell
the
producers
Warner
would
n't
terminate
their
agreement
.

That
announcement
was
roundly
criticized
by
Mayor
Koch
--
who
has
endorsed
Mr.
Dinkins
--
because
the
city
faces
a
garbage
crisis
and
has
already
spent
$
5
million
planning
for
an
incinerator
that
would
be
scrapped
under
Mr.
Dinkins
's
proposal
.

The
company
has
long
struggled
to
deliver
a
strong
mainframe-class
product
,
and
made
a
costly
decision
in
1988
to
halt
development
of
an
interim
product
meant
to
stem
the
revenue
losses
at
the
high
end

The

In

said
,
``

Maybe
the
problem
is
a
political
system
that
wo

act
without
an

At

Mr.
Chan
used
to
be
an
oddity
in
Hanoi
:
a
private
entrepreneur
.

The
Indian
stock
markets
have
been
on
a
five-year
high
,
with
dips
and
corrections
,
since
Prime
Minister
Rajiv
Gandhi
started
liberalizing
industry
.

It
has
always
been
true
that
those
outside
the
club
want
to
climb
in
,
and
that
a
few
will
cut
corners
in
the
process
.

In
a
separate
SEC
filing
,
Albert
Safer
,
who
holds
6.46
%
of
United
Merchants
,
said
he
retained
investment
bank
Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
for
advice
as
he
evaluates
the
possibility
of
making
a
bid
for
the
textile
maker
.

The
company
said
the
redemption
is
permitted
because
the
price
of
Addington

has
equaled
or
exceeded
$
19.60
for
20
consecutive
trading
days

condition
set
in
the
terms
of
the

As
a
result
,
the
OEX
insurance
may
or
may
not
fully
protect
an
investor
's
holdings
in
the
event
of
a
market
decline
.

Imperial
is
in
the
midst
of
reducing
its
junk-bond
holdings
and
getting
out
of
the
investment
banking
business
in
order
to
return
to
traditional
thrift
activities
.

This
same
tendency
toward
openness
impressed
a
group
of
visiting
U.S.
congressmen
this
spring
.

President
Bush
's
national
security
adviser
,
Lt.
Gen.
Brent
Scowcroft
,
came
into
office
in
January
intent
on
making
the
NSC
staff
leaner
and
more
disciplined
than
it
had
been
during
the
Reagan
administration
.

Demand
will
come
first
from
programming
production
companies
and
then
from
television
stations
.

Ways

veteran

moves

Budget
Committee

Rep.
Cardin
(

replaces
him
...
.

Vice
President
Quayle
and
Budget
Director
Darman
said
recently
they
've
joined
the
search
.

The
announcement
fueled
speculation
for
future
advances
in
the
shares
.

He
furthermore
denies
that
he
relied
too
heavily
on
Sotheby
's
or
Mr.
Wachter
.

So
its
senior
executives
are
talking
openly
about
possibly
buying
back
some
of
the
company
's
$
172.5
million
in
subordinated
convertible
debentures
next
year
.

The
agency
then
turned
to
a
former
backup
singer
for
Ms.
Midler
who
appeared
in
the
ad
and
crooned
what
was
generally
considered
a
more
than
credible
imitation
of
Ms.
Midler
's
1973
hit
song
``
Do
You
Wanna
Dance
.
''

Then
,
as
if
to
show
that
he
could
play
fast
as
well
,
he
offered
the
second
movement
from
Saint-Saens
's
Sonata
for
Clarinet
,
a
whimsical
,
puckish
tidbit
that
reflected
the
flip
side
of
the
Stoltzman
personality
.

``
We
've
gotten
through
two
stock
market
crashes

and
we
've
gone

''
says
David
Hale
,
an
economist
of
Kemper
Financial
Services
.

Her
bare
breasts
,
her
dancing
,
her
voice
,
her
beauty
and
,
perhaps
most
famously
,
her
derriere
,
were
prominent
attractions
,
but
courage
of
a
rare
sort
made
her
remarkable
life
possible
.

Mr.
Kriz
of
Moody
's
said
the
problems
in
the
securities
portfolio
stem
largely
from
positions
taken
last
year
.

IBM
,
though
long
a
leader
in
the
Japanese
mainframe
business
,
did
n't
introduce
its
first
PC
in
Japan
until
five
years
after
NEC
did
,
and
that
was
n't
compatible
even
with
the
U.S.
IBM
standard
.

If
the
case
is
converted
to
Chapter
7
,
what
remains
of
the
oil
tycoon
's
once-vast
estate
--
now
believed
to
have
a
value
of
less
than
$
125
million
--
would
be
sold
off
quickly
with
most
of
the
proceeds
going
to
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
,
whose
claim
for
$
300
million
in
back
taxes
has
priority
in
the
case
.

His
point
was
there
is
no
reason
for
East
Germany
to
copy
Soviet-style
changes
.

Although
Columbia
had
a
good
summer
with
``
Ghostbusters
II
''
and
``
When
Harry
Met
Sally
,
''
rivals
such
as
Warner
,
Paramount
Pictures
,
Walt
Disney
Co.
and
Universal
Studios
have
been
thrashing
Columbia
at
the
box
office
.

In
the
early
1970s
,
Mr.
Smith
modeled
his
fledgling
company
on
Tiger
's
innovation
of
hub-and-spoke
and
containerized-cargo
operations
.

The
implication
that
I
was
pushed
aside
would
n't
be
accurate
,
''
Mr.
Roman
said
.

Just
last
week
,
would-be
thieves
damaged
three
Sagos
at
Mr.
Whitelock
's
home
in
the
Eagle
Rock
section
before
something
frightened
them
off
,
foiled
.

Mr.
Edelman
said
the
decision
``
has
nothing
to
do
with
Marty
Ackerman
.
''

``
I
'm
not
sure
they
're
going
to
make
it
work
,
''
says
Mr.
Anderson
.

With
other
anxious
calls
pouring
in
,
he
recalls
,
``
I
'd
either
have
to
disconnect
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
or
go
out
to
the
secretary
's
desk

And
in
July
,
Nissan
's
Tennessee
manufacturing
plant
beat
back
a
United
Auto
Workers
organizing
effort
with
aggressive
tactics
that
have
left
some
workers
bitter
.

Despite
the
widening
gap
between
the
two
sides
,
conferees
eventually
followed
the
pattern
set
in
previous
years
by
opting
to
roughly
split
the
difference
.

For
fiscal
1988
,
Ashland
had
net
of
$
224
million
,
or

4.01
a

on

of

The
book
is
patronizing
about
this
nouveau
riche
struggle
for
respectability
,
which
has
its
tawdry
aspects
.

But
if
you
happen
to
be
coming
to
Chicago
in
the
next
few
weeks
,
do
n't
fail
to
have
a
look
at
Robert
Falls
's
``
The
Misanthrope
''
at
the
Goodman
.

The
selling
by
money
managers
and
individual
investors
is
turning
traders
bearish
as
well
.

In
addition
,
on
Jan.
1
,
Thomas
A.
Bennett
,
52
,
will
become
vice
chairman
and
chief
operating
officer
of
Wachovia
and
Wachovia
Bank
&
Trust
,
filling
a
vacancy
left
by
the
retired
Hans
W.
Wanders
in
April
.

Beyond
that
,
money
managers
and
analysts
see
other
problems
.

Y.J.
Park
and
her
family
scrimped
for
four
years
to
buy
a
tiny
apartment
here
,
but
found
that
the
closer
they
got
to
saving
the
$
40,000
they
originally
needed
,
the
more
the
price
rose
.

If
a
compromise
ca
n't
be
reached
,
the
pilots
maintain
they
can
do
a
transaction
without
the
support
of
the
machinists
.

The
real
tragedies
occurred
elsewhere
,
as
we
soon
found
out
.

Excise-tax
returns
due
by
Oct.
31
or
Nov.
30
may
be
delayed
to
Jan.
16
.

Ending
tax-free
shopping
in
the
European
Community
after
1992
could
threaten
more
than
3,000
jobs
,
the
International
Duty
Free
Confederation
said
.

It
does
prolong
the
pain
somewhat
.
